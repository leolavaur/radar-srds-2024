baseline:
  name: Bertoli2022 (normalized)
  description: |
    This baseline implements the work of Bertoli et al. (2022) [1]. Some choices have been
    made to make the baselines comparable:
    
    - We only implement the stacked-unsupervised federated learning approach, using only
      benign data, as we considered the clients to only have access to normal data for
      training. The authors also tested their appraoch with a second threshold, computed
      using malicious samples. We did not implement this second threshold.

    Furthermore, this baseline uses the normalized version of the EFC. Without it, the
    energy values are around 800--1100, which takes a massive predescence over the other
    features. We here normalize the energy values to be between 0 and 1, which makes the
    energy values comparable to the others.
