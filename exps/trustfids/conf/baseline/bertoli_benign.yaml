baseline:
  name: Bertoli2022 (benign)
  description: |
    This baseline implements the work of Bertoli et al. (2022) [1]. Some choices have been
    made to make the baselines comparable:
    
    - We only implement the stacked-unsupervised federated learning approach, using only
      benign data, as we considered the clients to only have access to normal data for
      training. The authors also tested their appraoch with a second threshold, computed
      using malicious samples. We did not implement this second threshold.

    This version differs by calculating energies on the benign data only, and therefore
    without labels. In fact, while the authors claim they use unsupervised learning, the
    presence of labels in the EFC's training makes it supervised.
