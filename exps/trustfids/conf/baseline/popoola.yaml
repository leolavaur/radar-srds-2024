baseline:
  name: Popoola local
  description: |
    This baseline implements the work of Popoola et al. (2021) [1]. Some choices have been
    made to make the baselines comparable:
    
    - We simply implement the local model architecture, as its evaluation in the paper
    suggests good performance on each dataset. The local training is done with Adam and
    a learning rate of 0.0001, as suggested by the authors.
