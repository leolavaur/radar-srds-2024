	doi = {10.23919/CNSM46954.2019.9012668},
	abstract = {Anomaly detection remains a challenging task due to both the ever more complex functions that need to be executed and the evolution of current networking devices which induces limitation of computational resources such as the Internet of Things ({IoT}). Furthermore, results of anomaly function computations can be repeated gradually over time or executed in neighboring nodes, thus leading to a waste of such limited computing resources in constrained nodes. To tackle these issues, the content-centric paradigm enhanced with computing features offers a promising solution to reduce the computation resources and finally improve the scalability of anomaly detection functions. In this paper, we propose a first step toward a content-oriented control plane which enables the distribution of the processing and the sharing of results of anomaly detection functions in the network. We present the way we leverage {NFN} to support Bayesian Network inference to detect anomalies in network traffic. The relevance and performance of our proposed approach are demonstrated by considering the Content Poisoning Attack ({CPA}) through numerous experiment data.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9839172},
	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is gaining momentum as a prominent solution to perform training procedures without the need to move sensitive end-user data to a centralized third party server. In {FL}, models are locally trained at distributed end-devices, acting as clients, and only model updates are transferred from the clients to the aggregator, which is in charge of global model aggregation. Although {FL} can ensure better privacy preservation than centralized machine learning ({ML}), it exhibits still some concerns. First, clients need to be properly discovered and selected to ensure that highly accurate models are built. Second, huge models may still require to be exchanged from the aggregator to all the selected clients, incurring a not negligible network footprint. To tackle such issues, in this paper, we propose a framework built upon in-network caching, multicast and name based data delivery, natively provided by the Named Data Networking ({NDN}) paradigm, in order to support client discovery and aggregator-clients data exchange. Benefits of the proposal are showcased when compared to a conventional application-layer solution.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is an emerging paradigm for distributed training of large-scale deep neural networks in which participants’ data remains on their own devices with only model updates being shared with a central server. However, the distributed nature of {FL} gives rise to new threats caused by potentially malicious participants. In this paper, we study targeted data poisoning attacks against {FL} systems in which a malicious subset of the participants aim to poison the global model by sending model updates derived from mislabeled data. We first demonstrate that such data poisoning attacks can cause substantial drops in classification accuracy and recall, even with a small percentage of malicious participants. We additionally show that the attacks can be targeted, i.e., they have a large negative impact only on classes that are under attack. We also study attack longevity in early/late round training, the impact of malicious participant availability, and the relationships between the two. Finally, we propose a defense strategy that can help identify malicious participants in {FL} to circumvent poisoning attacks, and demonstrate its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Federated machine learning which enables resource-constrained node devices (e.g., Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices and smartphones) to establish a knowledge-shared model while keeping the raw data local, could provide privacy preservation, and economic benefit by designing an effective communication protocol. However, this communication protocol can be adopted by attackers to launch data poisoning attacks for different nodes, which has been shown as a big threat to most machine learning models. Therefore, we in this article intend to study the model vulnerability of federated machine learning, and even on {IoT} systems. To be specific, we here attempt to attacking a popular federated multitask learning framework, which uses a general multitask learning framework to handle statistical challenges in the federated learning setting. The problem of calculating optimal poisoning attacks on federated multitask learning is formulated as a bilevel program, which is adaptive to the arbitrary selection of target nodes and source attacking nodes. We then propose a novel systems-aware optimization method, called as attack on federated learning ({AT}2FL), to efficiently derive the implicit gradients for poisoned data, and further attain optimal attack strategies in the federated machine learning. This is an earlier work, to our knowledge, that explores attacking federated machine learning via data poisoning. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate that when the attackers directly poison the target nodes or indirectly poison the related nodes via using the communication protocol, the federated multitask learning model is sensitive to both poisoning attacks.},

	abstract = {Multi-objective learning problems occur in all aspects of life and have been studied for decades, including in the field of machine learning. Many such problems also exist in distributed settings, where data cannot easily be shared. In recent years, joint machine learning has been made possible in such settings through the development of the Federated Learning ({FL}) paradigm. However, there is as of now very little research on the general problem of extending the {FL} concept to multi- objective learning, limiting such problems to non-cooperative individual learning. We address this gap by presenting a general framework for multi-objective {FL}, based on decomposition ({MOFL}/D). Our framework addresses the a posteriori type of multi-objective problem, where user preferences are not known during the optimisation process, allowing multiple participants to jointly find a set of solutions, each optimised for some distribution of preferences. We present an instantiation of the framework and validate it through experiments on a set of multi-objective benchmarking problems that are extended from well-known single- objective benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning ({FL}) constructs a distributed machine learning framework that involves multiple remote clients collaboratively training models. However in real-world situations, the emergence of non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-{IID}) data makes the global model generated by traditional {FL} algorithms no longer meet the needs of all clients, and the accuracy is greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose a personalized federated multi-task learning method via similarity awareness ({PFedSA}), which captures the similarity between client data through model parameters uploaded by clients, thus facilitating collaborative training of similar clients and providing personalized models based on each client’s data distribution. Specifically, it generates the intrinsic cluster structure among clients and introduces personalized patch layers into the cluster to personalize the cluster model. {PFedSA} also maintains the generalization ability of models, which allows each client to benefit from nodes with similar data distributions when training data, and the greater the similarity, the more benefit. We evaluate the performance of the {PFedSA} method using {MNIST}, {EMNIST} and {CIFAR}10 datasets, and investigate the impact of different data setting schemes on the performance of {PFedSA}. The results show that in all data setting scenarios, the {PFedSA} method proposed in this paper can achieve the best personalization performance, having more clients with higher accuracy, and it is especially effective when the client’s data is non-{IID}.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been increasingly applied to improve human activity recognition ({HAR}) accuracy and reduce the human efforts of handcrafted feature extractions. Federated Learning ({FL}) is an emerging learning paradigm that enables the collaborative learning of a global model without exposing users' raw data. However, existing {FL} approaches yield unsatisfactory {HAR} performance as they fail to dynamically aggregate models according to the statistical diversity of users' data. In this paper, we propose {FedDL}, a novel federated learning system for {HAR} that can capture the underlying user relationships and apply them to learn personalized models for different users dynamically. Specifically, we design a dynamic layer sharing scheme that learns the similarity among users' model weights to form the sharing structure and merges models accordingly in an iterative, bottom-up layer-wise manner. {FedDL} merges local models based on the dynamic sharing scheme, significantly speeding up the convergence while maintaining high accuracy. We have implemented {FedDL} and evaluated using a new data set we collected using {LiDAR} and four public real-world datasets involving 178 users in total. The results show that {FedDL} outperforms several state-of-the-art {FL} paradigms in terms of model accuracy (by more than 15\%), converging rate (by more than 70\%), and communication overhead (about 30\% reduction). Moreover, the testing results on the datasets of different scales show that {FedDL} has high scalability and hence can be deployed for large-scale real-world applications.},

Building accurate prediction models requires knowledge from many organizations; alas, this entails disclosing sensitive information, such as network structures, security postures, and policies, which might often be undesirable or outright impossible. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Federated Learning ({FL}) to predict future security events. To this end, we introduce Cerberus, a system enabling collaborative training of Recurrent Neural Network ({RNN}) models for participating organizations. The intuition is that {FL} could potentially offer a middle-ground between the non-private approach where the training data is pooled at a central server and the low-utility alternative of only training local models. We instantiate Cerberus on a dataset obtained from a major security company's intrusion prevention product and evaluate it vis-à-vis utility, robustness, and privacy, as well as how participants contribute to and benefit from the system. Overall, our work sheds light on both the positive aspects and the challenges of using {FL} for this task and paves the way for deploying federated approaches to predictive security.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks ({GTN}), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a blockchain-assisted cross-silo graph federated learning (B-{CGFL}) framework is presented for large-scale network intrusion detection, aiming to break down barriers among different organizations and achieve a secure and transparent multi-party collaboration ecosystem. The network scenario is divided into multiple regions. Organizations in each region leverage graph neural networks to analyze local network flow topology information and identify traffic types accurately. With cross-silo graph federated learning, coordinators and organizations collaboratively complete the training and updating of global intrusion detection models. Multiple coordinators jointly maintain a chain to improve the global model’s scalability and storage security. Oracle nodes bridge the off-chain data provider and on-chain smart contracts, enabling secure transmission in off-chain model accuracy testing. For fair competition, a reputation-aware model incentive mechanism is designed to improve global model quality. Security analysis confirms that B-{CGFL} can defend against inference attacks, model plagiarism, and tampering with model test results. Experiments on three challenging datasets {ToN}-{IoT}, {CSE}-{CIC}-{IDS}2018, and {BoT}-{IoT} demonstrate that compared with benchmark machine learning methods, B-{CGFL} exhibits superior performance in accuracy and F1-score and facilitates model quality improvement.},

However, the lack of transparency in federated learning creates a security threat. Since the server cannot ensure the clients’ reliability by analyzing their data, malicious clients have the opportunity to insert a backdoor in the model and activate it to evade detection. To maximize their chances of success, adversaries must fine-tune the attack parameters. Here we evaluate the impact of four attack parameters on the effectiveness, stealthiness, consistency, and timing of data poisoning attacks. Our results show that each parameter is decisive for the success of poisoning attacks, provided they are carefully adjusted to avoid damaging the model’s accuracy or the data’s consistency. Our findings serve as guidelines for the security evaluation of federated learning systems and insights for defense strategies.

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is becoming a popular paradigm for collaborative learning over distributed, private datasets owned by non-trusting entities. {FL} has seen successful deployment in production environments, and it has been adopted in services such as virtual keyboards, autocompletion, item recommendation, and several {IoT} applications. However, {FL} comes with the challenge of performing training over largely heterogeneous datasets, devices, and networks that are out of the control of the centralized {FL} server. Motivated by this inherent setting, we make a ﬁrst step towards characterizing the impact of device and behavioral heterogeneity on the trained model. We conduct an extensive empirical study spanning close to 1.5K unique conﬁgurations on ﬁve popular {FL} benchmarks. Our analysis shows that these sources of heterogeneity have a major impact on both model performance and fairness, thus sheds light on the importance of considering heterogeneity in {FL} system design.},

	abstract = {The decentralized nature of federated learning makes detecting and defending against adversarial attacks a challenging task. This paper focuses on backdoor attacks in the federated learning setting, where the goal of the adversary is to reduce the performance of the model on targeted tasks while maintaining a good performance on the main task. Unlike existing works, we allow non-malicious clients to have correctly labeled samples from the targeted tasks. We conduct a comprehensive study of backdoor attacks and defenses for the {EMNIST} dataset, a real-life, user-partitioned, and non-iid dataset. We observe that in the absence of defenses, the performance of the attack largely depends on the fraction of adversaries present and the “complexity” of the targeted task. Moreover, we show that norm clipping and “weak” differential privacy mitigate the attacks without hurting the overall performance. We have implemented the attacks and defenses in {TensorFlow} Federated ({TFF}), a {TensorFlow} framework for federated learning. In open sourcing our code, our goal is to encourage researchers to contribute new attacks and defenses and evaluate them on standard federated datasets.},

	abstract = {Federated learning allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a joint model without sharing local data. This enables applications of machine learning in settings of inherently distributed, undisclosable data such as in the medical domain. In practice, joint training is usually achieved by aggregating local models, for which local training objectives have to be in expectation similar to the joint (global) objective. Often, however, local datasets are so small that local objectives differ greatly from the global objective, resulting in federated learning to fail. We propose a novel approach that intertwines model aggregations with permutations of local models. The permutations expose each local model to a daisy chain of local datasets resulting in more efficient training in data-sparse domains. This enables training on extremely small local datasets, such as patient data across hospitals, while retaining the training efficiency and privacy benefits of federated learning.},

One important ﬁeld for {FL} deployment is emerging {IoT} applications. In particular, {FL} has been recently used for {IoT} intrusion detection systems where clients, e.g., a home security gateway, monitors trafﬁc data generated by {IoT} devices in its network, trains a local intrusion detection model, and send this model to a central entity, the aggregator, who then computes a global model (using the models of all gateways) that is distributed back to clients. This approach protects the privacy of users as it does not require local clients to share their potentially private {IoT} data with any other parties, and it is in general more efﬁcient than a centralized system. However, {FL} schemes have been subject to poising attacks, in particular to backdoor attacks.},

	abstract = {Recently, federated learning-based network intrusion detection system ({FL}-based {NIDS}) has been considered as an essential tool to protect network security. It enables learning an effective intrusion detection model collaboratively without data privacy leakage. However, {FL}- based {NIDS} has exhibited inherent vulnerabilities on the data poisoning attacks launched by malicious clients. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic robustness evaluations of {FL}-based {NIDS} under data poisoning attack. Firstly, in consideration of the traffic domain constraints, we design the clean-label data poisoning attack against {FL}-based {NIDS}. Specifically, we propose an improved poisoned sample generation model based on Generative Adversarial Network, called {PT}-{GAN}, which optimizes with a new loss function that incorporates the feedback of the target intrusion detection model. The minimally-perturbed and correctly-labeled traffic samples generated by {PT}-{GAN} are then injected in the local training dataset to corrupt the intrusion detection model. Then, we explore the potential defense mechanism for these data poisoning attacks against {FL}- based {NIDS} and propose a novel defense method based on poisoned sample detection. Concretely, we propose the important neuron activations extraction method based on the layerwise relevance propagation method and then apply Oneclass-{SVM} to detect the poisoned sample. Experiments show that the proposed {PT}-{GAN} can degrade the performance of {FL}-based {NIDS} up to 28\% on {UNSW}-{NB}15 dataset. We also demonstrate the robustness of our proposed defense methods against data poisoning attacks.},

	abstract = {The importance of information sharing to ensuring network and information security is widely acknowledged by both policy-makers and by the technical and practitioner community – for example, in the European Programme on Critical Infrastructure Protection ({EPCIP}) and in the 2004 Availability and Robustness of Electronic Communications Infrastructures ({ARECI}) study, which noted that formal means for sharing information should be set up in order to ―improve the protection and rapid restoration of infrastructure critical to the reliability of communications within and throughout Europe‖. A 2009 gap analysis conducted by {ENISA} of good practice in respect of telecommunication network operators identified information sharing as a set of useful best practice. Given the acknowledged importance of information sharing, this report sets out findings from a research project into the barriers to and incentives for information sharing in the field of network and information security, in the context of peer-to-peer groups such as Information Exchanges ({IE}) and Information Sharing Analysis Centres ({ISACs}).{\textbackslash}{nMethods} and approach The information in this report is drawn from three sources: {\textbackslash}n A review of available literature – both academic and non-academic publications,  Interviews with key informants working in the field of network and information {\textbackslash}nsecurity and in {IEs},  A two-round Delphi exercise with network and information security professionals. {\textbackslash}n The aim of this project is to identify those barriers and incentives which are most important in day-to-day practice in {IEs} and {ISACs}. This research differs from other work in this field in being firmly grounded in the experiences of practitioners and those involved in {IE} and Information Sharing activities.

Therefore, the findings of this research are a first step to developing an evidence base in this field, but we do not claim they are generalisable to all kinds of {IEs}. {\textbackslash}{nIncentives} and challenges for information sharing Our findings indicate that many of the barriers and incentives commonly identified in the {\textbackslash}navailable literature are of relatively low importance to practitioners and security officials currently working in {IEs}. As part of this research we asked practitioners to rank a list of barriers and incentives in terms of their relative importance. Our findings indicate that the incentives which are most important are: {\textbackslash}n Economic incentives stemming from cost savings;  Incentives stemming from the quality, value, and use of information shared. {\textbackslash}n While the barriers which are the most important are: {\textbackslash}n Poor quality information;  Misaligned economic incentives stemming from reputational risks;  Poor management.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 enable novel business cases, such as client-specific production, real-time monitoring of process condition and progress, independent decision making and remote maintenance, to name a few. However, they are more susceptible to a broad range of cyber threats because of limited resources and heterogeneous nature. Such risks cause financial and reputational damages for businesses, well as the theft of sensitive information. The higher level of diversity in industrial network prevents the attackers from such attacks. Therefore, to efficiently detect the intrusions, a novel intrusion detection system known as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Explainable Artificial Intelligence framework ({BiLSTM}-{XAI}) is developed. Initially, the preprocessing task using normalization and standardization is performed to enhance the data quality for detecting network intrusions. Subsequently, the significant features are selected from the databases using the Krill herd optimization ({KHO}) algorithm. The proposed {BiLSTM}-{XAI} approach provides better security and privacy inside the industry networking system by detecting intrusions very precisely. In this, we utilized {SHAP} and {LIME} explainable {AI} algorithms to further improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental setup is made by {MATLAB} 2016 software using Honeypot and {NSL}-{KDD} datasets as input. The analysis result reveals that the proposed method achieves superior performance in detecting intrusions with a classification accuracy of 98.2\%.},

          Extracting useful knowledge from big data is important for machine learning. When data is privacy-sensitive and cannot be directly collected, federated learning is a promising option that extracts knowledge from decentralized data by learning and exchanging model parameters, rather than raw data. However, model parameters may encode not only non-private knowledge but also private information of local data, thereby transferring knowledge via model parameters is not privacy-secure. Here, we present a novel knowledge transfer method named {PrivateKT}, which uses actively selected small public data to transfer high-quality knowledge in federated learning with privacy guarantees. We verify {PrivateKT} on three different datasets, and results show that {PrivateKT} can maximally reduce 84\% of the performance gap between centralized learning and existing federated learning methods under strict differential privacy restrictions. {PrivateKT} provides a potential direction to effective and privacy-preserving knowledge transfer in machine intelligent systems.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning ({DL}) models can be trained to automatically learn the underlying features of the traffic patterns in {IoT} networks to detect complex botnet attacks. However, the performance of a neural network model largely depends on the set of hyperparameters that is used for the model development. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal set of hyperparameters (the numbers of hidden layers and hidden units, the learning rate, the optimiser, the activation function, the batch size, and the number of epochs) for efficient {DLbased} botnet detection in {IoT} networks. The {DL} models employ a Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) architecture for binary and multi-class classification. {DNN}-based botnet detection models are developed and experiments are performed with the {BotIoT} and N-{BaIoT} datasets to validate the effectiveness of the hyperparameter optimisation method. Experiment results showed that the proposed method produced {DNN} models that achieved high botnet attack detection rates, low false alarm rates, and near real-time computation speed.},

	title = {Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering},
	abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including {PhD} students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology.

The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research.

The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Les systèmes informatiques ont connu récemment de grandes avancées dans leur conception. D'une part, la démocratisation des réseaux via la croissance exponentielle de l'Internet a permis d'envisager des systèmes à l'échelle mondiale, visant de mettre en commun une multitude de ressources à travers la planète entière. D'autre part, la réduction continue de la taille des équipements informatiques a permis l'apparition de matériels miniatures. Le jumelage de ces deux évolutions est à l'origine de l'apparition des réseaux de capteurs sans fil. Le spectre des applications potentielles de ces réseaux est extrêmement large, que cela soit dans le contexte d'une infrastructure fixe autant que dans l'informatique embarquée. Cette thèse propose un ensemble de contributions pour la gestion de l'information à la fois dans le contexte mobile et statique. Édifiées autour des mêmes propriétés de collaboration et d'auto-organisation, ces propositions sont conçues selon une méthodologie de la théorie vers la pratique. Cette thèse vise ainsi, en premier lieu, une analyse théorique a priori d'une application classique des réseaux de capteurs statiques, à savoir le suivi de trajectoires d'objets mobiles non identifiés. Par la suite, nous étendons le spectre des applications visées en proposant une structure générique à toute mise en oeuvre réelle de réseaux de capteurs statiques. En second lieu, nous considérons une modélisation de la mobilité permettant d'analyser fondamentalement les impacts de celle-ci sur la convergence des protocoles dits de population. Enfin, nous établissons un parallèle entre les travaux menés théoriquement sur les réseaux de capteurs mobiles avec ceux plus pratiques et empiriques proposés dans le cadre des protocoles épidémiques sur réseaux filaires. En démontrant que ces deux domaines portent en réalité sur la même classe de protocoles -- et donc de problèmes -- nous ouvrons ainsi une voie captivante pour de futures recherches dans chacun de ces deux domaines, par l'utilisation de l'un dans l'autre.},

	abstract = {Federated edge learning ({FEEL}) is a fast-growing distributed learning technique for next-generation wireless edge systems. Smart systems in different application domains suffer from data heterogeneity, limited wireless resources, and device heterogeneity, necessitating the need for intelligent participants’ selection schemes that accelerate the convergence rate. Hence, this paper proposes joint participants selection and bandwidth allocation schemes to address these challenges. First, we formulate an optimization problem considering communication and computation latencies and imbalanced data distribution that meets a target round deadline and bandwidth constraints. To tackle participant selection combinatorial problems, we use a relaxation method followed by a proposed priority selection algorithm to select near-optimal participants. The proposed algorithm initially prioritizes participants with more data, effective channel states, and better {CPU} speed. To tackle data heterogeneity, we propose a randomized deadline controlling algorithm that diversifies the updates by enabling the edge server to involve various participants with small data samples into training rounds. The proposed algorithms provide near-optimal performance compared to the brute-force method. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme accelerates the convergence rate by up to 55\% under extensive non-i.i.d settings compared to benchmarks. Additionally, the controlling algorithm significantly improves the performance of the high data heterogeneity levels, resulting in faster {FEEL} systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11315},
	abstract = {Network Intrusion Detection Systems ({NIDSs}) are important tools for the protection of computer networks against increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber attacks. Recently, a lot of research eﬀort has been dedicated to the development of Machine Learning ({ML}) based {NIDSs}. As in any {ML}-based application, the availability of high-quality datasets is critical for the training and evaluation of {ML}-based {NIDS}. One of the key problems with the currently available {NIDS} datasets is the lack of a standard feature set. The use of a unique and proprietary set of features for each of the publicly available datasets makes it virtually impossible to compare the performance of {ML}-based traﬃc classiﬁers on diﬀerent datasets, and hence to evaluate the ability of these systems to generalise across diﬀerent network scenarios. To address that limitation, this paper proposes and evaluates standard {NIDS} feature sets based on the {NetFlow} network meta-data collection protocol and system. We evaluate and compare two {NetFlow}-based feature set variants, a version with 12 features, and another one with 43 features. For our evaluation, we converted four widely used {NIDS} datasets ({UNSW}-{NB}15, {BoT}-{IoT}, {ToN}-{IoT}, {CSE}-{CIC}-{IDS}2018) into new variants with our proposed {NetFlow} based feature sets. Based on an Extra Tree classiﬁer, we compared the classiﬁcation performance of the {NetFlow}-based feature sets with the proprietary feature sets provided with the original datasets. While the smaller feature set cannot match the classiﬁcation performance of the proprietary feature sets, the larger set with 43 {NetFlow} features, surprisingly achieves a consistently higher classiﬁcation performance compared to the original feature set, which was tailored to each of the considered {NIDS} datasets. The proposed {NetFlow}-based standard {NIDS} feature set, together with four benchmark datasets, made available to the research community, allow a fair comparison of {ML}-based network traﬃc classiﬁers across diﬀerent {NIDS} datasets. We believe that having a standard feature set is critical for allowing a more rigorous and thorough evaluation of {ML}-based {NIDSs} and that it can help bridge the gap between academic research and the practical deployment of such systems.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is an emerging paradigm allowing large-scale decentralized learning without sharing data across different data owners, which helps address the concern of data privacy in medical image analysis. However, the requirement for label consistency across clients by the existing methods largely narrows its application scope. In practice, each clinical site may only annotate certain organs of interest with partial or no overlap with other sites. Incorporating such partially labeled data into a uniﬁed federation is an unexplored problem with clinical signiﬁcance and urgency. This work tackles the challenge by using a novel federated multi-encoding U-Net (Fed-{MENU}) method for multi-organ segmentation. In our method, a multi-encoding {UNet} ({MENU}-Net) is proposed to extract organ-speciﬁc features through different encoding sub-networks. Each sub-network can be seen as an expert of a speciﬁc organ and trained for that client. Moreover, to encourage the organ-speciﬁc features extracted by different sub-networks to be informative and distinctive, we regularize the training of the {MENU}-Net by designing an auxiliary generic decoder ({AGD}). Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that our Fed-{MENU} method can effectively obtain a federated learning model using the partially labeled datasets with superior performance to other models trained by either localized or centralized learning methods. Source code will be made publicly available at the time of paper publication.},

Speciﬁcally, we present a new variant of the classic federated averaging ({FedAvg}) algorithm, which supports both asynchronous communication and communication compression. We provide a new analysis technique showing that, in spite of these system relaxations, our algorithm essentially matches the best known bounds for {FedAvg}, under reasonable parameter settings.

	abstract = {With the emergence of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence ({AI}) services and applications in the Cyber Physical Systems ({CPS}), the methods of protecting {CPS} against cyber threats is becoming more and more challenging. Various security solutions are implemented to protect {CPS} networks from cyber attacks. For instance, Machine Learning ({ML}) methods have been deployed to automate the process of anomaly detection in {CPS} environments. The core of {ML} is deep learning. However, it has been found that deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Attackers can launch the attack by applying perturbations to input samples to mislead the model, which results in incorrect predictions and low accuracy. For example, the Fast Gradient Sign Method ({FGSM}) is a white-box attack that calculates gradient descent oppositely to maximize the loss and generates perturbations by adding the gradient to unpolluted data. In this study, we focus on the impact of adversarial attacks on deep learning-based anomaly detection in {CPS} networks and implement a mitigation approach against the attack by retraining models using adversarial samples. We use the Bot-{IoT} and Modbus {IoT} datasets to represent the two {CPS} networks. We train deep learning models and generate adversarial samples using these datasets. These datasets are captured from {IoT} and Industrial {IoT} ({IIoT}) networks. They both provide samples of normal and attack activities. The deep learning model trained with these datasets showed high accuracy in detecting attacks. An Artiﬁcial Neural Network ({ANN}) is adopted with one input layer, four intermediate layers, and one output layer. The output layer has two nodes representing the binary classiﬁcation results. To generate adversarial samples for the experiment, we used a function called the ‘fast gradient method’ from the Cleverhans library. The experimental result demonstrates the inﬂuence of {FGSM} adversarial samples on the accuracy of the predictions and proves the effectiveness of using the retrained model to defend against adversarial attacks.},

In this work, we propose a novel {FL} approach ({DP}-{SCAFFOLD}) to tackle these two challenges together by incorporating Diﬀerential Privacy ({DP}) constraints into the popular {SCAFFOLD} algorithm. We focus on the challenging setting where users communicate with a “honest-but-curious” server without any trusted intermediary, which requires to ensure privacy not only towards a third party observing the ﬁnal model but also towards the server itself. Using advanced results from {DP} theory and optimization, we establish the convergence of our algorithm for convex and non-convex objectives. Our paper clearly highlights the trade-oﬀ between utility and privacy and demonstrates the superiority of {DP}-{SCAFFOLD} over the state-ofthe-art algorithm {DP}-{FedAvg} when the number of local updates and the level of heterogeneity grows.

	abstract = {The cyber-threat landscape has evolved tremendously in recent years, with new threat variants emerging daily, and large-scale coordinated campaigns becoming more prevalent. In this study, we propose {CELEST} ({CollaborativE} {LEarning} for Scalable Threat detection), a federated machine learning framework for global threat detection over {HTTP}, which is one of the most commonly used protocols for malware dissemination and communication. {CELEST} leverages federated learning in order to collaboratively train a global model across multiple clients who keep their data locally, thus providing increased privacy and conﬁdentiality assurances. Through a novel active learning component integrated with the federated learning technique, our system continuously discovers and learns the behavior of new, evolving, and globally-coordinated cyber threats. We show that {CELEST} is able to expose attacks that are largely invisible to individual organizations. For instance, in one challenging attack scenario with data exﬁltration malware, the global model achieves a three-fold increase in Precision-Recall {AUC} compared to the local model. We deploy {CELEST} on two university networks and show that it is able to detect the malicious {HTTP} communication with high precision and low false positive rates. Furthermore, during its deployment, {CELEST} detected a set of previously unknown 42 malicious {URLs} and 20 malicious domains in one day, which were conﬁrmed to be malicious by {VirusTotal}.},

	abstract = {Although the existing machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in the Internet of Things ({IoT}) usually perform well in static environments, they struggle to preserve their performance over time, in dynamic environments. Yet, the {IoT} is a highly dynamic and heterogeneous environment, leading to what is known as data drift and concept drift. Data drift is a phenomenon which embodies the change that happens in the relationships among the independent features, which is mainly due to changes in the data quality over time. Concept drift is a phenomenon which depicts the change in the relationships between input and output data in the machine learning model over time. To detect data and concept drifts, we ﬁrst propose a drift detection technique that capitalizes on the Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) method to study the change in the variance of the features across the intrusion detection data streams. We also discuss an online outlier detection technique that identiﬁes the outliers that diverge both from historical and temporally close data points. To counter these drifts, we discuss an online deep neural network that dynamically adjusts the sizes of the hidden layers based on the Hedge weighting mechanism, thus enabling the model to steadily learn and adapt as new intrusion data come. Experiments conducted on an {IoT}-based intrusion detection dataset suggest that our solution stabilizes the performance of the intrusion detection on both the training and testing data compared to the static deep neural network model, which is widely used for intrusion detection.},

	abstract = {With privacy legislation empowering users with the right to be forgotten, it has become essential to make a model forget about some of its training data. We explore the problem of removing any client’s contribution in federated learning ({FL}). During {FL} rounds, each client performs local training to learn a model that minimizes the empirical loss on their private data. We propose to perform unlearning at the client (to be erased) by reversing the learning process, i.e., training a model to maximize the local empirical loss. In particular, we formulate the unlearning problem as a constrained maximization problem by restricting to an 2-norm ball around a suitably chosen reference model to help retain some knowledge learnt from the other clients’ data. This allows the client to use projected gradient descent to perform unlearning. The method does neither require global access to the data used for training nor the history of the parameter updates to be stored by the aggregator (server) or any of the clients. Experiments on the {MNIST} dataset show that the proposed unlearning method is efﬁcient and effective.},

Collaboration assumes, however, the availability of knowledge transfer mechanisms, which are not trivial for deep learning models where knowledge isn't easily attributed to precise model slices. We present Canoe - a framework that facilitates knowledge transfer for neural networks. Canoe provides new system support for dynamically extracting significant parameters from a helper node's neural network and uses this with a multi-model boosting-based approach to improve the predictive performance of the target node. The evaluation of Canoe with different {PyTorch} and {TensorFlow} neural network models demonstrates that the knowledge transfer mechanism improves the model's adaptiveness to changes up to 3.5X compared to learning in isolation, while affording several magnitudes reduction in data movement costs compared to federated learning.},

	abstract = {Newton-type methods are popular in federated learning due to their fast convergence. Still, they suﬀer from two main issues, namely: low communication eﬃciency and low privacy due to the requirement of sending Hessian information from clients to parameter server ({PS}). In this work, we introduced a novel framework called {FedNew} in which there is no need to transmit Hessian information from clients to {PS}, hence resolving the bottleneck to improve communication eﬃciency. In addition, {FedNew} hides the gradient information and results in a privacy-preserving approach compared to the existing state-of-the-art. The core novel idea in {FedNew} is to introduce a two level framework, and alternate between updating the inverse Hessian-gradient product using only one alternating direction method of multipliers ({ADMM}) step and then performing the global model update using Newton’s method. Though only one {ADMM} pass is used to approximate the inverse Hessian-gradient product at each iteration, we develop a novel theoretical approach to show the converging behavior of {FedNew} for convex problems. Additionally, a signiﬁcant reduction in communication overhead is achieved by utilizing stochastic quantization. Numerical results using real datasets show the superiority of {FedNew} compared to existing methods in terms of communication costs.},

	shorttitle = {Dap-{FL}},
	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}), an attractive and promising distributed machine learning paradigm, has sparked extensive interest in exploiting tremendous data stored on ubiquitous mobile devices. However, conventional {FL} suffers severely from resource heterogeneity, as clients with weak computational and communication capability may be unable to complete local training using the same local training hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose Dap-{FL}, a deep deterministic policy gradient ({DDPG})-assisted adaptive {FL} system, in which local learning rates and local training epochs are adaptively adjusted by all resource-heterogeneous clients through locally deployed {DDPGassisted} adaptive hyper-parameter selection schemes. Particularly, the rationality of the proposed hyper-parameter selection scheme is conﬁrmed through rigorous mathematical proof. Besides, due to the thoughtlessness of security consideration of adaptive {FL} systems in previous studies, we introduce the Paillier cryptosystem to aggregate local models in a secure and privacypreserving manner. Rigorous analyses show that the proposed Dap-{FL} system could guarantee the security of clients’ private local models against chosen-plaintext attacks and chosen-message attacks in a widely used honest-but-curious participants and active adversaries security model. In addition, through ingenious and extensive experiments, the proposed Dap-{FL} achieves higher global model prediction accuracy and faster convergence rates than conventional {FL}, and the comprehensiveness of the adjusted local training hyper-parameters is validated. More importantly, experimental results also show that the proposed Dap-{FL} achieves higher model prediction accuracy than two state-of-the-art {RLassisted} {FL} methods, i.e., 6.03\% higher than {DDPG}-based {FL} and 7.85\% higher than {DQN}-based {FL}.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) has emerged as an effective approach to address consumer privacy needs. {FL} has been successfully applied to certain machine learning tasks, such as training smart keyboard models and keyword spotting.

One of the key challenges faced by practical {FL} adoption for {DL}-based ranking and recommendation is the prohibitive resource requirements that cannot be satisﬁed by modern mobile systems. We propose Federated Ensemble Learning ({FEL}) as a solution to tackle the large memory requirement of deep learning ranking and recommendation tasks. {FEL} enables large-scale ranking and recommendation model training on-device by simultaneously training multiple model versions on disjoint clusters of client devices. {FEL} integrates the trained sub-models via an over-arch layer into an ensemble model that is hosted on the server. Our experiments demonstrate that {FEL} leads to 0.43–2.31\% model quality improvement over traditional on-device federated learning — a signiﬁcant improvement for ranking and recommendation system use cases.},

Traditional machine learning classification methods will cause low classification accuracy, high communication costs, and privacy leakage issues. Federated Learning enables several clients to train a deep learning model collaboratively without requiring any of the clients to share their local data with a centralized server. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based federated incremental learning algorithm: Fed-{SOINN}. We introduce the attention mechanism to improve the weight of parameters uploaded by clients which are beneficial to the global model, where instead of the full gradient, only a small subset of important gradients is communicated. Meanwhile, we improve the sparsity of the model by upgrading the online optimization function in Fed-{SOINN}, it also brings faster convergence speed and higher accuracy in the changeable network environment. Results reveal that Fed-{SOINN} has improved detection accuracy by 3.1\% compared with benchmark methods and can reduce the number of communications rounds up to 73\%. When facing new traffic categories, the incremental learning mechanism in Fed-{SOINN} also effectively identify unknown traffic categories.},

In this work, we propose an {FL} scheme to address both challenges simultaneously. Speciﬁcally, we enable edge devices to learn self-distilled neural networks that are readily prunable to arbitrary sizes, which capture the knowledge of the learning domain in a nested and progressive manner. Not only does our approach tackle system heterogeneity by serving edge devices with varying model architectures, but it also alleviates the issue of connection uncertainty by allowing transmitting part of the model parameters under faulty network connections, without wasting the contributing knowledge of the transmitted parameters. Extensive empirical studies show that under system heterogeneity and network instability, our approach demonstrates signiﬁcant resilience and higher communication efﬁciency compared to the state-of-the-art.},

By coupling the communication topology and the heterogeneity, our analysis sheds light on the poorly understood interplay between these two concepts in decentralized learning. We then argue that neighborhood heterogeneity provides a natural criterion to learn data-dependent topologies that reduce (and can even eliminate) the otherwise detrimental effect of data heterogeneity on the convergence time of D-{SGD}. For the important case of classification with label skew, we formulate the problem of learning such a good topology as a tractable optimization problem that we solve with a Frank-Wolfe algorithm. As illustrated over a set of simulated and real-world experiments, our approach provides a principled way to design a sparse topology that balances the convergence speed and the per-iteration communication costs of D-{SGD} under data heterogeneity.},

To protect the privacy of data and models, we exploit Gausian differentials on the information shared with each other when updating their local models.

Different from finite-time control, fixed-time cooperative control produces the faster rate of convergence and provides an explicit estimation of the settling time independent of initial conditions, which is desirable for multiagent systems. This paper aims at presenting an overview of recent advances in fixed-time cooperative control of multiagent systems. Some fundamental concepts about finite- and fixed-time stability and stabilization are first recalled with insight understanding. Then, recent results in finite- and fixed-time cooperative control are reviewed in detail and categorized according to different agent dynamics.

However, existing {PFL} solutions assume that clients have sufficient training samples to jointly induce personalized models. Thus, existing {PFL} solutions cannot perform well in a few-shot scenario, where most or all clients only have a handful of samples for training. Furthermore, existing few-shot learning ({FSL}) approaches typically need centralized training data; as such, these {FSL} methods are not applicable in decentralized scenarios. How to enable {PFL} with limited training samples per client is a practical but understudied problem. In this article, we propose a solution called personalized federated few-shot learning ({pFedFSL}) to tackle this problem. Specifically, {pFedFSL} learns a personalized and discriminative feature space for each client by identifying which models perform well on which clients, without exposing local data of clients to the server and other clients, and which clients should be selected for collaboration with the target client. In the learned feature spaces, each sample is made closer to samples of the same category and farther away from samples of different categories. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that {pFedFSL} outperforms competitive baselines across different settings.},

Applying federated learning to edge computing can protect the privacy of edge clients and benefit edge computing. Nevertheless, eavesdroppers can analyze the parameter information to specify clients’ private information and model features. And it is difficult to achieve a high privacy level, convergence, and low communication overhead during the entire process in the {FL} framework. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for edge computing ({PFLF}). In {PFLF}, each client and the application server add noise before sending the data. To protect the privacy of clients, we design a flexible arrangement mechanism to count the optimal training times for clients. We prove that {PFLF} guarantees the privacy of clients and servers during the entire training process. Then, we theoretically prove that {PFLF} has three main properties: 1) For a given privacy level and model aggregation times, there is an optimal number of participating times for clients; 2) There is an upper and lower bound of convergence; 3) {PFLF} achieves low communication overhead by designing a flexible participation training mechanism. Simulation experiments confirm the correctness of our theoretical analysis. Therefore, {PFLF} helps design a framework to balance privacy levels and convergence and achieve low communication overhead when there is a part of clients dropping out of training.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is identiﬁed as a crucial enabler for large-scale distributed machine learning ({ML}) without the need for local raw dataset sharing, substantially reducing privacy concerns and alleviating the isolated data problem. In reality, the prosperity of {FL} is largely due to a centralized framework called {FedAvg} [1], in which workers are in charge of model training and servers are in control of model aggregation. However, {FedAvg}’s centralized worker-server architecture has raised new concerns, be it the low scalability of the cluster, the risk of data leakage, and the failure or even defection of the central server. To overcome these problems, we propose Decentralized Federated Trusted Averaging ({DeFTA}), a decentralized {FL} framework that serves as a plug-and-play replacement for {FedAvg}, instantly bringing better security, scalability, and fault-tolerance to the federated learning process after installation. In principle, it fundamentally resolves the above-mentioned issues from an architectural perspective without compromises or tradeoffs, primarily consisting of a new model aggregating formula with theoretical performance analysis, and a decentralized trust system ({DTS}) to greatly improve system robustness. Note that since {DeFTA} is an alternative to {FedAvg} at the framework level, prevalent algorithms published for {FedAvg} can be also utilized in {DeFTA} with ease. Extensive experiments on six datasets and six basic models suggest that {DeFTA} not only has comparable performance with {FedAvg} in a more realistic setting, but also achieves great resilience even when 66\% of workers are malicious. Furthermore, we also present an asynchronous variant of {DeFTA} to endow it with more powerful usability.},

But, existing fuzzy search schemes lack efficiency due to their high computational overhead and do not support file dynamic updates. This paper proposes an efficient dynamic multi-keyword fuzzy search scheme for encrypted cloud data to support dynamic file updates. Locality sensitive hashing ({LSH}) and Bloom filters are employed to generate index vectors and query vectors. Based on the generated vectors, a balanced binary tree is constructed as the index for the entire file set, and a Top-k search algorithm is developed to search k files that are most relevant to a given query with the help of the index tree.

First, we present a platform architecture of blockchain-based federated learning systems for failure detection in {IIoT}, which enables verifiable integrity of client data. In the architecture, each client periodically creates a Merkle tree in which each leaf node represents a client data record, and stores the tree root on a blockchain. Further, to address the data heterogeneity issue in {IIoT} failure detection, we propose a novel centroid distance weighted federated averaging ({CDW}{\textbackslash}\_FedAvg) algorithm taking into account the distance between positive class and negative class of each client dataset. In addition, to motivate clients to participate in federated learning, a smart contact based incentive mechanism is designed depending on the size and the centroid distance of client data used in local model training. A prototype of the proposed architecture is implemented with our industry partner, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, accuracy and performance. The results show that the approach is feasible, and has satisfactory accuracy and performance.},

We build a secure {FL}-based {NIDS} that is robust for the poisoning attacks, namely {SecFedNIDS}. Firstly, we propose the model-level defensive mechanism based on poisoned model detection. Specifically, we propose the gradient-based important model parameter selection method to provide the effective low-dimensional representations of the uploaded local model parameters, and then we propose the online unsupervised poisoned model detection method to identify the poisoned models and reject them to join in the global intrusion detection model. Subsequently, we design the data-level defensive mechanism based on poisoned data detection. Notably, we propose a novel poisoned data detection method based on class path similarity, to filter out the poisoned traffic data and avoid them participating in subsequent local training. We adopt layer-wise relevance propagation to extract the class path of clean traffic data, and transmit the class paths to the poisoned clients to help distinguish the poisoned traffic data. Results show that {SecFedNIDS} with the proposed model-level defense boosts the accuracy by up to 48\% under the poisoning attacks on {UNSW}-{NB}15 dataset and 36\% on {CICIDS}2018 dataset, and the proposed data-level defense further improves its accuracy by up to 13\% on {CICIDS}2018 dataset.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00464},
	abstract = {Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to build models to effectively detect unseen anomalies by only training on the normal data. Although previous reconstruction-based methods have made fruitful progress, their generalization ability is limited due to two critical challenges. First, the training dataset only contains normal patterns, which limits the model generalization ability. Second, the feature representations learned by existing models often lack representativeness which hampers the ability to preserve the diversity of normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive Memory Network with Self-supervised Learning ({AMSL}) to address these challenges and enhance the generalization ability in unsupervised anomaly detection. Based on the convolutional autoencoder structure, {AMSL} incorporates a self-supervised learning module to learn general normal patterns and an adaptive memory fusion module to learn rich feature representations. Experiments on four public multivariate time series datasets demonstrate that {AMSL} signiﬁcantly improves the performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Speciﬁcally, on the largest {CAP} sleep stage detection dataset with 900 million samples, {AMSL} outperforms the second-best baseline by 4\%+ in both accuracy and F1 score. Apart from the enhanced generalization ability, {AMSL} is also more robust against input noise.},

	abstract = {Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) have demonstrated their potential in federated learning, i.e., learning a centralized model from data privately hosted by multiple sites. A {federatedGAN} jointly trains a centralized generator and multiple private discriminators hosted at different sites. A major theoretical challenge for the federated {GAN} is the heterogeneity of the local data distributions. Traditional approaches cannot guarantee to learn the target distribution, which isa mixture of the highly different local distributions. This paper tackles this theoretical challenge, and for the first time, provides a provably correct framework for federated {GAN}. We propose a new approach called Universal Aggregation, which simulates a centralized discriminator via carefully aggregating the mixture of all private discriminators. We prove that a generator trained with this simulated centralized discriminator can learn the desired target distribution. Through synthetic and real datasets, we show that our method can learn the mixture of largely different distributions where existing federated {GAN} methods fail.},

	abstract = {Medical diagnostic image analysis (e.g., {CT} scan or X-Ray) using machine learning is an efficient and accurate way to detect {COVID}-19 infections. However, sharing diagnostic images across medical institutions is usually not allowed due to the concern of patients' privacy. This causes the issue of insufficient datasets for training the image classification model. Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that produces an unbiased global model based on the received updates of local models trained by clients without exchanging clients' local data. Nevertheless, the default setting of federated learning introduces huge communication cost of transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when data heterogeneity of clients heavily exists. To improve communication efficiency and model performance, in this paper, we propose a novel dynamic fusion-based federated learning approach for medical diagnostic image analysis to detect {COVID}-19 infections. First, we design an architecture for dynamic fusion-based federated learning systems to analyse medical diagnostic images. Further, we present a dynamic fusion method to dynamically decide the participating clients according to their local model performance and schedule the model fusion-based on participating clients' training time. In addition, we summarise a category of medical diagnostic image datasets for {COVID}-19 detection, which can be used by the machine learning community for image analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and performs better than the default setting of federated learning in terms of model performance, communication efficiency and fault tolerance.},

Control of the {MASs} are often coordinated through information interaction among agents, which is one of the most important factors affecting coordination and cooperation performance. However, unexpected physical faults and cyber attacks on a single agent may spread to other agents via information interaction very quickly, and thus could lead to severe degradation of the whole system performance and even destruction of {MASs}.

	abstract = {We present a class of methods for robust, personalized federated learning, called Fed+, that uniﬁes many federated learning algorithms. The principal advantage of this class of methods is to better accommodate the real-world characteristics found in federated training, such as the lack of {IID} data across parties, the need for robustness to outliers or stragglers, and the requirement to perform well on party-speciﬁc datasets. We achieve this through a problem formulation that allows the central server to employ robust ways of aggregating the local models while keeping the structure of local computation intact. Without making any statistical assumption on the degree of heterogeneity of local data across parties, we provide convergence guarantees for Fed+ for convex and non-convex loss functions and robust aggregation. The Fed+ theory is also equipped to handle heterogeneous computing environments including stragglers without additional assumptions; speciﬁcally, the convergence results cover the general setting where the number of local update steps across parties can vary. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of Fed+ through extensive experiments across standard benchmark datasets as well as on a challenging real-world problem in ﬁnancial portfolio management where the heterogeneity of party-level data can lead to training failure in standard federated learning approaches.},

Current anomaly detection technology suffers from low detection accuracy, high false alarm rate and lack of labeled data. Anomaly detection is of great practical importance as an effective means to detect anomalies in the data and provide important support for the normal operation of various systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection classification model that incorporates federated learning and mixed Gaussian variational self-encoding networks, namely {MGVN}. The proposed {MGVN} network model first constructs a variational self-encoder using a mixed Gaussian prior to extracting features from the input data, and then constructs a deep support vector network with the mixed Gaussian varia­ tional self-encoder to compress the feature space. The {MGVN} finds the minimum hypersphere to separate the normal and abnormal data and measures the abnormal fraction by calculating the Euclidean distance between the data features and the hypersphere center. Federated learning is finally incorporated with {MGVN} ({FL}-{MGVN}) to effectively address the problems that multiple participants collaboratively train a global model without sharing private data. The experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets such as {NSL}-{KDD}, {MNIST} and Fashion-{MNIST}, which demonstrate that the proposed {FL}-{MGVN} has higher recognition performance and classification accuracy than other methods.

	abstract = {Network Slicing ({NS}) is a predominant technology in future telecommunication networks, including Fifth Generation (5G), which supports the realization of heterogeneous applications and services. It allows the allocation of a dedicated logical network slice of the physical network to each application. Security is one of the paramount challenges in an {NS} ecosystem. Several technologies, including Machine Learning ({ML}), have been proposed to mitigate security challenges in 5G networks. However, the use of {ML} for {NS} security is not properly implemented. Especially, the scarcity of coordination and the difficulties of privacy-protected information sharing between slices cause failures and performance degradation of these {ML} based {NS} security solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Federated Learning ({FL}) based coordinated security orchestration architecture named Federated Learning enabled Security Orchestrator ({FLeSO}) to centrally perform security operations in a slicing ecosystem while preserving the privacy of the data. In addition, the proposed {FLeSO} architecture enables features such as proactive security deployment and steady security level maintenance independent of the slicing strategy. The proposed architecture is implemented in a realworld slicing testbed, and a comprehensive set of experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed {FLeSO} architecture. The test results illustrate the significant advantage of the proposed approach over the legacy system in terms of improving the security of an {NS} ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is rapidly gaining popularity and enables multiple data owners (a.k.a. {FL} participants) to collaboratively train machine learning models in a privacy-preserving way. A key unaddressed scenario is that these {FL} participants are in a competitive market, where market shares represent their competitiveness. Although they are interested to enhance the performance of their respective models through {FL}, market leaders (who are often data owners who can contribute significantly to building high performance {FL} models) want to avoid losing their market shares by enhancing their competitors’ models. Currently, there is no modeling tool to analyze such scenarios and support informed decision-making. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing the market share-based decision support framework for participation in {FL} ({MarS}-{FL}). We introduce two notions of δ-stable market and friendliness to measure the viability of {FL} and the market acceptability of {FL}. The {FL} participants’ behaviours can then be predicted using game theoretic tools (i.e., their optimal strategies concerning participation in {FL}). If the market δ-stability is achievable, the final model performance improvement of each {FL}-{PT} shall be bounded, which relates to the market conditions of {FL} applications. We provide tight bounds and quantify the friendliness, κ, of given market conditions to {FL}. Experimental results show the viability of {FL} in a wide range of market conditions. Our results are useful for identifying the market conditions under which collaborative {FL} model training is viable among competitors, and the requirements that have to be imposed while applying {FL} under these conditions.},

In this paper, we propose a Robust Transformer-based Intrusion Detection System ({RTIDS}) reconstructing feature representations to make a trade-off between dimensionality reduction and feature retention in imbalanced datasets. The proposed method utilizes positional embedding technique to associate sequential information between features, then a variant stacked encoder-decoder neural network is used to learn low-dimensional feature representations from high-dimensional raw data. Furthermore, we apply self-attention mechanism to facilitate network traffic type classifications. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed {RTIDS} on two publicly available real traffic intrusion detection datasets named {CICIDS}2017 and {CIC}-{DDoS}2019 with F1-Score of 99.17\% and 98.48\% respectively.

	abstract = {Industrial Internet-of-Things ({IIoT}) facilitate private data collecting via(a broad range of) sensors, and the analysis of such data can inform decision-making at different levels. Federated learning can be used to analyze the collected data, in privacy preserving manner by transmitting model updates instead of private data in {IIoT} networks. The federated learning framework is, however, vulnerable because model updates are easily tampered with by malicious agents. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel chameleon hash scheme with changeable trapdoor ({CHCT}) for secure federated learning in {IIoT} settings. Our scheme imposes various constraints on the use of trapdoor. We give a rigorous security analysis on our {CHCT} scheme. We also instantiate the {CHCT} scheme as a redactable medical blockchain. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practical utility of {CHCT} in terms of accuracy and efﬁciency.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICBDA.2019.8713213},
	abstract = {Convolution Neural Network ({ConvNet}) offers a high potential to generalize input data. It has been widely used in many application areas, such as visual imagery, where comprehensive learning datasets are available and a {ConvNet} model can be well trained and perform the required function effectively. {ConvNet} can also be applied to network intrusion detection. However, the currently available datasets related to the network intrusion are often inadequate, which makes the {ConvNet} learning deﬁcient, hence the trained model is not competent in detecting unknown intrusions. In this paper, we propose a {ConvNet} model using transfer learning for the network intrusion detection. The model consists of two concatenated {ConvNets} and is built on a two-stage learning process: learning a base dataset and transferring the learned knowledge to the learning of the target dataset. Our experiments on the {NSLKDD} dataset show that the proposed model can improve the detection accuracy not only on the test dataset containing mostly known attacks ({KDDTest}+) but also on the test dataset featuring many novel attacks ({KDDTest}-21) – about 2.68\% improvement on {KDDTest}+ and 22.02\% on {KDDTest}-21 can be achieved, as compared to the traditional {ConvNet} model.},

	abstract = {Industrial control systems ({ICSs}) are closely related to human life. In recent years, many {ICSs} have been connected to the Internet rather than being physically isolated, which has improved business efficiency while also increasing the risks of being attacked. The security issues of {ICSs} have gotten a lot of interest in the research community because attack events that aim at {ICSs} can cause catastrophic damage. An intrusion detection system ({IDS}) serves as an important tool for providing protection. Many {IDS} studies using machine learning and deep learning have been proposed. However, high-dimensional data may cause overfitting, resulting in inferior performance. To improve the classification performance, we suggest a dimension reduction technique based on the supervised autoencoder ({SupervisedAE}) and principal components analysis ({PCA}) in this study. To obtain more discriminative latent representations, compared with the conventional autoencoder, the {SupervisedAE} absorbs the label information during the training process. In this way, the improved autoencoder model is trained with reconstruction error and classification error simultaneously. Based on the latent representations extracted from the {SupervisedAE}, we add the {PCA} algorithm. The additional {PCA} algorithm reduces the dimension of features further. We conduct a series of experiments utilizing the suggested technique on a public power system data set to evaluate the performance. Compared with various dimension reduction methods, including autoencoder variants, the technique proposed in this study shows higher performance. In the meanwhile, it outperforms some existing detection methods in terms of accuracy and F1 score.},

Anomaly-based {IDSs} may deploy machine learning algorithms to classify events either as normal or anomalous and trigger the adequate response. When using supervised learning, these algorithms require classiﬁed, rich, and recent datasets. Thus, to foster the performance of these machine learning models, datasets can be generated from different sources in a collaborative approach, and trained with multiple algorithms. This paper proposes a vote-based architecture to generate classiﬁed datasets and improve the performance of supervised learning-based {IDSs}. On a regular basis, multiple {IDSs} in different locations send their logs to a central system that combines and classiﬁes them using different machine learning models and a majority vote system. Then, it generates a new and classiﬁed dataset, which is trained to obtain the best updated model to be integrated into the {IDS} of the companies involved. The proposed architecture trains multiple times with several algorithms. To shorten the overall runtimes, the proposed architecture was deployed in Fed4FIRE+ with Ray to distribute the tasks by the available resources. A set of machine learning algorithms and the proposed architecture were assessed. When compared with a baseline scenario, the proposed architecture enabled to increase the accuracy by 11.5\% and the precision by 11.2\%.},

Backpropagation neural networks (i.e., {BP}-{NNs}) based approaches have recently drawn attention because of their good generalization capability. In a typical situation, {BP}-{NN}-based models are iteratively optimized in server machines with input data gathered from the edge devices. However, (1) the iterative optimization often requires signiﬁcant efforts to follow changes in the distribution of normal data (i.e., concept drift), and (2) data transfers between edge and server impose additional latency and energy consumption. To address these issues, we propose {ONLAD} and its {IP} core, named {ONLAD} Core. {ONLAD} is highly optimized to perform fast sequential learning to follow concept drift in less than one millisecond. {ONLAD} Core realizes on-device learning for edge devices at low power consumption, which realizes standalone execution where data transfers between edge and server are not required. Experiments show that {ONLAD} has favorable anomaly detection capability in an environment that simulates concept drift. Evaluations of {ONLAD} Core conﬁrm that the training latency is 1.95x\$6.58x faster than the other software implementations. Also, the runtime power consumption of {ONLAD} Core implemented on {PYNQ}-Z1 board, a small {FPGA}/{CPU} {SoC} platform, is 5.0x\$25.4x lower than them.},

	abstract = {Today's cyber attacks require a new line of security defenses. The static approach of traditional security based on heuristic and signature does not match the dynamic nature of new generation of threats that are known to be evasive, resilient and complex. Organizations need to gather and share real-time cyber threat information and to transform it to threat intelligence in order to prevent attacks or at least execute timely disaster recovery. Threat Intelligence ({TI}) means evidence-based knowledge representing threats that can inform decisions. There is a general awareness for the need of threat intelligence while vendors today are rushing to provide a diverse array of threat intelligence products, specifically focusing on Technical Threat Intelligence ({TTI}). Although threat intelligence is being increasingly adopted, there is little consensus on what it actually is, or how to use it. Without any real understanding of this need, organizations risk investing large amounts of time and money without solving existing security problems. Our paper aims to classify and make distinction among existing threat intelligence types. We focus particularly on the {TTI} issues, emerging researches, trends and standards. Our paper also explains why there is a reluctance among organizations to share threat intelligence. We provide sharing strategies based on trust and anonymity, so participating organizations can do away with the risks of business leak. We also show in this paper why having a standardized representation of threat information can improve the quality of {TTI}, thus providing better automated analytics solutions on large volumes of {TTI} which are often non-uniform and redundant. Finally, we evaluate most popular open source/free threat intelligence tools, and compare their features with those of a new {AlliaCERT} {TI} tool.},

	abstract = {Predominant network intrusion detection systems ({NIDS}) aim to identify malicious traffic patterns based on a handcrafted dataset of rules. Recently, the application of machine learning in {NIDS} helps alleviate the enormous effort of human observation. Federated learning ({FL}) is a collaborative learning scheme concerning distributed data. Instead of sharing raw data, it allows a participant to share only a trained local model. Despite the success of existing {FL} solutions, in {NIDS}, a network’s traffic data distribution does not always fit into the single global model of {FL}; some networks have similarities with each other but other networks do not. We propose Segmented-Federated Learning (Segmented-{FL}), where by employing periodic local model evaluation and network segmentation, we aim to bring similar network environments to the same group. A comparison between {FL} and our method was conducted against a range of metrics including the weighted precision, recall, and F1 score, using a collected dataset from 20 massively distributed networks within 60 days. By studying the optimized hyperparameters of Segmented-{FL} and employing three evaluation methods, it shows that Segmented-{FL} has better performance in all three types of intrusion detection tasks, achieving validation weighted F1 scores of 0.964, 0.803, and 0.912 with Method A, Method B, and Method C respectively. For each method, this scheme shows a gain of 0.1\%, 4.0\% and 1.1\% in performance compared with {FL}.},

Lack of data balance as seen in rare classes affects the model accuracy. Generative Adversarial Networks ({GAN}) are remarkable in data augmentation to balance the available training data. In this article, we propose a novel Federated Deep Learning ({DL}) Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) using {GAN}, named {FEDGAN}-{IDS}, to detect cyber threats in smart Internet of Things ({IoT}) systems; smarthomes, smart e-healthcare systems and smart cities. We distribute the {GAN} network over {IoT} devices to act as a classifier and train using augmented local data. We compare the convergence and accuracy of our model with other federated intrusion detection models. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed {FEDGAN}-{IDS}.

In this paper, we consider a new architecture of digital twin empowered Industrial {IoT} where digital twins capture the characteristics of industrial devices to assist federated learning. Noticing that digital twins may bring estimation deviations from the actual value of device state, a trusted based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of such deviation. We adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of federated learning based on Lyapunov dynamic deﬁcit queue and deep reinforcement learning, to improve the learning performance under the resource constraints. To further adapt to the heterogeneity of Industrial {IoT}, a clustering-based asynchronous federated learning framework is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed framework is superior to the benchmark in terms of learning accuracy, convergence, and energy saving.},

	abstract = {The Internet threat landscape is fundamentally changing. A major shift away from hobby hacking toward well-organized cyber crime can be observed. These attacks are typically carried out for commercial reasons in a sophisticated and targeted manner, and specifically in a way to circumvent common security measures. Additionally, networks have grown to a scale and complexity, and have reached a degree of interconnectedness, that their protection can often only be guaranteed and financed as shared efforts. Consequently, new paradigms are required for detecting contemporary attacks and mitigating their effects. Today, many attack detection tasks are performed within individual organizations, and there is little cross-organizational information sharing. However, information sharing is a crucial step to acquiring a thorough understanding of large-scale cyber-attack situations, and is therefore seen as one of the key concepts to protect future networks. Discovering covert cyber attacks and new malware, issuing early warnings, advice about how to secure networks, and selectively distribute threat intelligence data are just some of the many use cases. In this survey article we provide a structured overview about the dimensions of cyber security information sharing. First, we motivate the need in more detail and work out the requirements for an information sharing system. Second, we highlight legal aspects and efforts from standardization bodies such as {ISO} and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}). Third, we survey implementations in terms of both organizational and technological matters. In this regard, we study the structures of Computer Emergency Response Teams ({CERTs}) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams ({CSIRTs}), and evaluate what we could learn from them in terms of applied processes, available protocols and implemented tools. We conclude with a critical review of the state of the art and highlight important considerations when building effective security information sharing platforms for the future.},

The rapid boom in the market worth of the internet of medical things ({IoMT}) captured cyber attackers' attention. Like health, medical data is also sensitive and worth a lot on the dark web. Despite the fact that the patient's health details have not been protected appropriately, letting the trespassers exploit them. The system administrator is unable to fortify security measures due to the limited storage capacity and computation power of the resource-constrained network devices'. Although various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify anomalies, the primary undertaking is to explore the swift progressing malicious attacks before they deteriorate the wellness system's integrity. In this paper, a Dew-Cloud based model is designed to enable hierarchical federated learning ({HFL}). The proposed Dew-Cloud model provides a higher level of data privacy with greater availability of {IoMT} critical application(s). The hierarchical long-term memory ({HLSTM}) model is deployed at distributed Dew servers with a backend supported by cloud computing. Data pre-processing feature helps the proposed model achieve high training accuracy ( 99.31 \%) with minimum training loss (0.034). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed {HFL}-{HLSTM} model is superior to existing schemes in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score.},

However, the security of the Internet and its applications is still an open research challenge. Researchers continuously working on novel network architectures such as {HTTP} as the narrow waist, Named Data Networking ({NDN}), programmable networks and Software-Defined Networking ({SDN}) for designing a more reliable network. Among these, {SDN} has emerged as a more robust and secure solution to combat against such malicious activities. In {SDN}, bifurcation of control plane and data plane provides more manageability, control, dynamic updating of rules, analysis, and global view of the network using a centralized controller. Though {SDN} seems a secured network architecture as compared to the conventional {IP}-based networks, still, {SDN} itself is vulnerable to many types of network intrusions and facing severe deployment challenges. This paper systematically reviews around 70 prominent {DDoS} detection and mitigation mechanisms in {SDN} networks. These mechanisms are characterized into four categories, viz: Information theory-based methods, Machine learning-based methods, Artificial Neural Networks ({ANN}) based methods and other miscellaneous methods. The paper also dowries and deliberates on various open research issues, gaps and challenges in the deployment of a secure {SDN}-based {DDoS} defence solution.

Yet, operators of such smart environments may not even be fully aware of their {IoTassets}, let alone whether each {IoT} device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a robust framework for {IoT} device classiﬁcation using trafﬁc characteristics obtained at the network level. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we instrument a smart environment with 28 different {IoT} devices spanning cameras, lights, plugs, motion sensors, appliances, and health-monitors. We collect and synthesize trafﬁc traces from this infrastructure for a period of six months, a subset of which we release as open data for the community to use. Second, we present insights into the underlying network trafﬁc characteristics using statistical attributes such as activity cycles, port numbers, signalling patterns, and cipher suites. Third, we develop a multi-stage machine learning based classiﬁcation algorithm and demonstrate its ability to identify speciﬁc {IoT} devices with over 99 percent accuracy based on their network activity. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs between cost, speed, and performance involved in deploying the classiﬁcation framework in real-time.

Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use {SDN} paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage {IoT} devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer {IoT} devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various {IoT} device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish {IoT} devices from non-{IoTs}, classify individual types of {IoT} devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).},

	abstract = {Federated learning is an improved version of distributed machine learning that further oﬄoads operations which would usually be performed by a central server. The server becomes more like an assistant coordinating clients to work together rather than micro-managing the workforce as in traditional {DML}. One of the greatest advantages of federated learning is the additional privacy and security guarantees it aﬀords. Federated learning architecture relies on smart devices, such as smartphones and {IoT} sensors, that collect and process their own data, so sensitive information never has to leave the client device. Rather, clients train a sub-model locally and send an encrypted update to the central server for aggregation into the global model. These strong privacy guarantees make federated learning an attractive choice in a world where data breaches and information theft are common and serious threats. This survey outlines the landscape and latest developments in data privacy and security for federated learning. We identify the diﬀerent mechanisms used to provide privacy and security, such as diﬀerential privacy, secure multi-party computation and secure aggregation. We also survey the current attack models, identifying the areas of vulnerability and the strategies adversaries use to penetrate federated systems. The survey concludes with a discussion on the open challenges and potential directions of future work in this increasingly popular learning paradigm.},

Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized {IoT}/{IIoT} architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in {IIoT}.

	abstract = {Today's Industrial Control Systems ({ICSs}) operating in critical infrastructures ({CIs}) are becoming increasingly complex; moreover, they are extensively interconnected with corporate information systems for cost-efficient monitoring, management and maintenance. This exposes {ICSs} to modern advanced cyber threats. Existing security solutions try to prevent, detect, and react to cyber threats by employing security measures that typically do not cross the organization's boundaries. However, novel targeted multi-stage attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats ({APTs}) take advantage of the interdependency between organizations. By exploiting vulnerabilities of various systems, {APT} campaigns intrude several organizations using them as stepping stones to reach the target infrastructure. A coordinated effort to timely reveal such attacks, and promptly deploy mitigation measures is therefore required. Organizations need to cooperatively exchange security-relevant information to obtain a broader knowledge on the current cyber threat landscape and subsequently obtain new insight into their infrastructures and timely react if necessary. Cyber security operation centers ({SOCs}), as proposed by the European {NIS} directive, are being established worldwide to achieve this goal. {CI} providers are asked to report to the responsible {SOCs} about security issues revealed in their networks. National {SOCs} correlate all the gathered data, analyze it and eventually provide support and mitigation strategies to the affiliated organizations. Although many of these tasks can be automated, human involvement is still necessary to enable {SOCs} to adequately take decisions on occurring incidents and quickly implement counteractions. In this paper we present a collaborative approach to cyber incident information management for gaining situational awareness on interconnected European {CIs}. We provide a scenario and an illustrative use-case for our approach; we propose a system architecture for a National {SOC}, defining the functional components and interfaces it comprises.

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is a new dawn of artificial intelligence ({AI}), in which machine learning models are constructed in a distributed manner while communicating only model parameters between a centralized aggregator and client internet-of-medical-things ({IoMT}) nodes. The performance of such a learning technique can be seriously hampered by the activities of a malicious jammer robot. In this paper, we study client selection and channel allocation along with the power control problem of the uplink {FL} process in {IoMT} domain under the presence of a jammer from the perspective of long-term learning duration. We map the interaction between the {FL} network and the jammer in each learning iteration as a Stackelberg game, in which the jammer acts as the leader and the {FL} network serves as the follower. We consider the client and channel selection as well as the power control jointly as the strategy of this game. Upon formulating the game, we find the joint best response strategy for both types of players by leveraging the difference of convex ({DC}) programming approach and the dual decomposition technique. Beside the availability of the complete information to both the players, we also study the problem from the perspective that the {FL} network knows the partial information of the other player. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the jamming game.},

	abstract = {Federated Leaning is an emerging approach to manage cooperation between a group of agents for the solution of Machine Learning tasks, with the goal of improving each agent's performance without disclosing any data. In this paper we present a novel algorithmic architecture that tackle this problem in the particular case of Anomaly Detection (or classification or rare events), a setting where typical applications often comprise data with sensible information, but where the scarcity of anomalous examples encourages collaboration. We show how Random Forests can be used as a tool for the development of accurate classifiers with an effective insight-sharing mechanism that does not break the data integrity. Moreover, we explain how the new architecture can be readily integrated in a blockchain infrastructure to ensure the verifiable and auditable execution of the algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss how this work may set the basis for a more general approach for the design of federated ensemble-learning methods beyond the specific task and architecture discussed in this paper.},

Federated learning has emerged as a possible solution to this problem in the last few years without compromising user privacy. Among different variants of the federated learning, noteworthy is federated transfer learning ({FTL}) that allows knowledge to be transferred across domains that do not have many overlapping features and users. In this work we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing works on this topic. In more details, we study the background of {FTL} and its different existing applications.

	abstract = {The resource-constrained and heterogeneous nature of Internet-of-Things ({IoT})devices coupled with the placement of such devices in publicly accessible venues complicate efforts to secure these devices and the networks they are connected to. The Internet-wide deployment of {IoT} devices also makes it challenging to operate security solutions at strategic locations within the network or to identify orchestrated activities from seemingly independent malicious events from such devices. Therefore, in this paper, we initially seek to determine the magnitude of {IoT} exploitations by examining more than 1 {TB} of passive measurement data collected from a/8 network telescope and by correlating it with 400 {GB} of information from the Shodan service. In the second phase of the study, we conduct in-depth discussions with Internet Service Providers ({ISPs})and backbone network operators, as well as leverage geolocation databases to not only attribute such exploitations to their hosting environment ({ISPs}, countries, etc.)but also to classify such inferred {IoT} devices based on their hosting sector type (financial, education, manufacturing, etc.)and most abused {IoT} manufacturers. In the third phase, we automate the task of alerting realms that are determined to be hosting exploited {IoT} devices. Additionally, to address the problem of inferring orchestrated {IoT} campaigns by solely observing their activities targeting the network telescope, we further introduce a theoretically sound technique based on L1-norm {PCA}, and validate the utility of the proposed data dimensionality reduction technique against the conventional L2-norm {PCA}. Specifically, we identify “in the wild” {IoT} coordinated probing campaigns that are targeting generic ports and campaigns specifically searching for open resolvers (for amplification purposes). The results reveal more than 120,000 Internet-scale exploited {IoT} devices, some of which are operating in critical infrastructure sectors such as health and manufacturing. We also infer 140 large-scale {IoT}-centric probing campaigns; a sample of which includes a worldwide distributed campaign where close to 40\% of its population includes video surveillance cameras from a single manufacturer, and another very large inferred coordinated campaign consisting of more than 50,000 {IoT} devices. The reported findings highlight the insecurity of the {IoT} paradigm at large and thus demonstrate the importance of understanding such evolving threat landscape.},

	abstract = {The Federated Learning ({FL}) paradigm is emerging as a way to train machine learning ({ML}) models in distributed systems. A large population of interconnected devices (i.e. Internet of Things ({IoT})) acting as local learners optimize the model parameters collectively (e.g., neural networks’ weights), rather than sharing and disclosing the training data set with the server. {FL} approaches assume each participant has enough training data for the tasks of interest. Realistically, data collected by {IoT} devices may be insufficient and often unlabeled. In particular, each {IoT} device may only contain one or a few samples of every relevant data category, and may not have the time or interest to label them. In realistic applications, this severely limits {FL}’s practicality and usability. In this paper, we propose a One-Shot Federated Learning ({OSFL}) framework considering a {FL} scenario wherein the local training is carried out on {IoT} devices and the global aggregation is done at the level of an edge server. Moreover, we combine model-free reinforcement learning with {OSFL} to design a more intelligent {IoT} device to infer whether to label a sample automatically or request the true label for the one-shot learning set-up. We validate our system on the {SODA}10M dataset. Experiments show that our solution achieves better performance than {DQN} and {RS} benchmark approaches.},

In this work, we focus on model-poisoning backdoor attacks, because they are characterized by their stealth and effectiveness. We claim that the model updates of the clients of a federated learning setting follow a Gaussian distribution, and those ones with an outlier behavior in that distribution are likely to be adversarial clients. We propose a new federated aggregation operator called Robust Filtering of one-dimensional Outliers ({RFOut}-1d), which works as a resilient defensive mechanism to modelpoisoning backdoor attacks. {RFOut}-1d is based on an univariate outlier detection method that filters out the model updates of the adversarial clients. The results on three federated image classification dataset show that {RFOut}-1d dissipates the impact of the backdoor attacks to almost nullifying them throughout all the learning rounds, as well as it keeps the performance of the federated learning model and it outperforms that state-of-the-art defenses against backdoor attacks.},

	abstract = {Anomaly based intrusion detection systems suffer from a lack of appropriate evaluation data sets. Often, existing data sets may not be published due to privacy concerns or do not reflect actual and current attack scenarios. In order to overcome these problems, we identify characteristics of good data sets and develop an appropriate concept for the generation of labelled flow-based data sets that satisfy these criteria. The concept is implemented based on {OpenStack}, thus demonstrating the suitability of virtual environments. Virtual environments offer advantages compared to static data sets by easily creating up-to-date data sets with recent trends in user behaviour and new attack scenarios. In particular, we emulate a small business environment which includes several clients and typical servers. Network traffic is generated by scripts which emulate typical user activities like surfing the web, writing emails, or printing documents on the clients. These scripts follow some guidelines to ensure that the user behaviour is as realistic as possible, also with respect to working hours and lunch breaks. The generated network traffic is recorded in unidirectional {NetFlow} format. For generating malicious traffic, attacks like Denial of Service, Brute Force, and Port Scans are executed within the network. Since origins, targets, and timestamps of executed attacks are known, labelling of recorded {NetFlow} data is easily possible. For inclusion of actual traffic, which has its origin outside the {OpenStack} environment, an external server with two services is deployed. This server has a public {IP} address and is exposed to real and up-to-date attacks from the internet. We captured approximately 32 million flows over a period of four weeks and categorized them into five classes. Further, the chronological sequence of the flows is analysed and the distribution of normal and malicious traffic is discussed in detail. The main contribution of this paper is the demonstration of a novel approach to use {OpenStack} as a basis for generating realistic data sets that can be used for the evaluation of network intrusion detection systems.},

Our results highlight the interplay between client heterogeneity and communication efﬁciency.

Biological systems, on the other hand, have intrinsic appealing characteristics as a result of billions of years of evolution, such as adaptivity to varying environmental conditions, inherent resiliency to failures and damages, successful and collaborative operation on the basis of a limited set of rules with global intelligence (which is larger than superposition of individuals).

To achieve this, and this is the second major difference with the non-cooperative approach, it adopts an axiomatic approach (or normative) by which we set upstream properties a priori reasonable (or desirable) on the outcome of the game.

	abstract = {Intrusion detection through classifying incoming packets is a crucial functionality at the network edge, requiring accuracy, efﬁciency and scalability at the same time, introducing a great challenge. On the one hand, traditional table-based switch functions have limited capacity to identify complicated network attack behaviors. On the other hand, machine learning based methods providing high accuracy are widely used for packet classiﬁcation, but they typically require packets to be forwarded to an extra host and therefore increase the network latency. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose an architecture with programmable data plane switches. We show that Binarized Neural Networks ({BNNs}) can be implemented as switch functions at the network edge classifying incoming packets at the line speed of the switches. To train {BNNs} in a scalable manner, we adopt a federated learning approach that keeps the communication overheads of training small even for scenarios involving many edge network domains. We next develop a prototype using the P4 language and perform evaluations. The results demonstrate that a multi-fold improvement in latency and communication overheads can be achieved compared to state-ofthe-art learning architectures.},

While past research has been focused on centralized intrusion detection assuming the existence of a central entity to store and perform analysis on data from all participant devices, these approaches cannot scale well with the fast growth of {IoT} connected devices and introduce a single-point failure risk that may compromise data privacy. Moreover, with data being widely spread across large networks of connected devices, decentralized computations are very much in need. In this context, we propose in this article a Federated Learning based scheme for {IoT} intrusion detection that maintains data privacy by performing local training and inference of detection models. In this scheme, not only privacy can be assured, but also devices can benefit from their peers’ knowledge by communicating only their updates with a remote server that aggregates the latter and shares an improved detection model with participating devices. We perform thorough experiments on an {NSL}-{KDD} dataset to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Experimental results and empirical analysis explore the robustness and advantages of the proposed Federated Learning detection model by reaching an accuracy close to that of the centralized approach and outperforming the distributed unaggregated on-device trained models.},

However, most recent studies have shown several vulnerabilities from attacks with a potential to jeopardize the integrity of the model, presenting a new window of research opportunity in terms of cyber-security. This survey is conducted with a main intention of highlighting the most relevant information related to security vulnerabilities in the context of machine learning ({ML}) classiﬁers; more speciﬁcally, directed towards training procedures against data poisoning attacks, representing a type of attack that consists of tampering the data samples fed to the model during the training phase, leading to a degradation in the model’s overall accuracy during the inference phase. This work compiles the most relevant insights and ﬁndings found in the latest existing literatures addressing this type of attacks. Moreover, this paper also covers several defense techniques that promise feasible detection and mitigation mechanisms, capable of conferring a certain level of robustness to a target model against an attacker. A thorough assessment is performed on the reviewed works, comparing the effects of data poisoning on a wide range of {ML} models in real-world conditions, performing quantitative and qualitative analyses. This paper analyzes the main characteristics for each approach including performance success metrics, required hyperparameters, and deployment complexity. Moreover, this paper emphasizes the underlying assumptions and limitations considered by both attackers and defenders along with their intrinsic properties such as: availability, reliability, privacy, accountability, interpretability, etc. Finally, this paper concludes by making references of some of main existing research trends that provide pathways towards future research directions in the ﬁeld of cyber-security.},

	abstract = {The individual and integration use of the Internet of Things ({IoT}), Information-Centric Networking ({ICN}), and Federated Learning ({FL}) have recently been used in several network-related scenarios and have consequently experienced a growing interest in the research community. Federated learning addresses the privacy and security issues of the {IoT} data in a decentralized manner. Also, it can be capable of training the multiple learning algorithms through local content except for exchanging data through intelligent Artificial Intelligence ({AI})-based algorithms. Moreover, in {ICN}, the content is retrieved and stored based on the content name rather than the content location address. On the other hand, it is challenging to support the massive {IoT} devices by the fifth generation (5G) mobile-cellular networks. Therefore, the cellular 6G networks are expected to increase the connection capabilities by 10–100 times over 5G, which necessitates a convergence of Communication, Computing, and Caching (3C). At the same time, the in-network caching capabilities of {ICN} can be attractive features for {IoT} networks. {IoT} aspires to link anybody and/or everything at any time and location. However, integrating {IoT} with different areas is a new academic topic and is still in its infancy. As a result, this research highlights the potential of {ICN} for {IoTs} by conducting an exhaustive literature review. This work provides a comprehensive survey regarding these three recent research trends (i.e., {FL}, {IoT}, and {ICN}) and reviews the related state-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each technology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we envision the integration of such technologies to take advantage efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise ({FL}-{ICN}-{IoT}) utilization based on the need for more robust security and privacy. Additionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both individually and combinedly. Finally, we discuss the open issues of the reviewed research and describe potential directions for future avenues regarding integrating {IoT}, {ICN}, and {FL} technologies.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 is all about doing things in a concurrent, secure, and fine-grained manner. {IoT} edge-sensors and their associated data play a predominant role in today’s industry ecosystem. Breaching data or forging source devices after injecting advanced persistent threats ({APT}) damages the industry owners’ money and loss of operators’ lives. The existing challenges include {APT} injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. Edgeservers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which in essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers while transporting data using traditional {PKI}-rendered trusts, consortium blockchain ({CBC}) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning, edge devices can filter malicious data at their end which largely motivates us to institute a Blockchain and {AI} aligned {APT} detection system. The unique contributions of the paper include efficient {APT} detection at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boost trust among collaborators and ensure an economical and sustainable mechanism after eliminating existing certificate authority. Finally, the edge-compliant storage technique facilitates efficient predictive maintenance. The respective experimental outcomes reveal that the proposed technique outperforms the other competing systems and models.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth of the use of insecure stationary and portable devices in the Internet of Things ({IoT}) network of the smart city has made the security of the smart city against cyber-attacks a vital issue. Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire {IoT} network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking ({SDN}) coupled with a blockchain technology for {IoT} network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of {SDN}, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the {IoT} network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, {SDN} is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire {IoT} network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the “single point of failure” problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time.},

	abstract = {The majority of multi-agent system ({MAS}) implementations aim to optimise agents' policies with respect to a single objective, despite the fact that many real-world problem domains are inherently multi-objective in nature. Multi-objective multi-agent systems ({MOMAS}) explicitly consider the possible trade-offs between conflicting objective functions. We argue that, in {MOMAS}, such compromises should be analysed on the basis of the utility that these compromises have for the users of a system. As is standard in multi-objective optimisation, we model the user utility using utility functions that map value or return vectors to scalar values. This approach naturally leads to two different optimisation criteria: expected scalarised returns ({ESR}) and scalarised expected returns ({SER}). We develop a new taxonomy which classifies multi-objective multi-agent decision making settings, on the basis of the reward structures, and which and how utility functions are applied. This allows us to offer a structured view of the field, to clearly delineate the current state-of-the-art in multi-objective multi-agent decision making approaches and to identify promising directions for future research. Starting from the execution phase, in which the selected policies are applied and the utility for the users is attained, we analyse which solution concepts apply to the different settings in our taxonomy. Furthermore, we define and discuss these solution concepts under both {ESR} and {SER} optimisation criteria. We conclude with a summary of our main findings and a discussion of many promising future research directions in multi-objective multi-agent systems.},

However, the traditional Centralized {DL} ({CDL}) method cannot be used to detect previously unknown (zero-day) botnet attack without breaching the data privacy rights of the users. In this paper, we propose Federated Deep Learning ({FDL}) method for zero-day botnet attack detection to avoid data privacy leakage in {IoT} edge devices. In this method, an optimal Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) architecture is employed for network trafﬁc classiﬁcation. A model parameter server remotely coordinates the independent training of the {DNN} models in multiple {IoT} edge devices, while Federated Averaging ({FedAvg}) algorithm is used to aggregate local model updates. A global {DNN} model is produced after a number of communication rounds between the model parameter server and the {IoT} edge devices. Zero-day botnet attack scenarios in {IoT} edge devices is simulated with the {BotIoT} and N-{BaIoT} data sets. Experiment results show that {FDL} model: (a) detects zero-day botnet attacks with high classiﬁcation performance; (b) guarantees data privacy and security; (c) has low communication overhead (d) requires low memory space for the storage of training data; and (e) has low network latency. Therefore, {FDL} method outperformed {CDL}, Localized {DL}, and Distributed {DL} methods in this application scenario.},

	abstract = {As the demand for Internet of Things ({IoT}) technologies continues to grow, {IoT} devices have been viable targets for malware infections. Although deep learning-based malware detection has achieved great success, the detection models are usually trained based on the collected user records, thereby leading to significant privacy risks. One promising solution is to leverage federated learning ({FL}) to enable distributed on-device training without centralizing the private user records. However, it is non-trivial for {IoT} users to label these records, where the quality and the trustworthiness of data labeling are hard to guarantee. To address the above issues, this paper develops a semi-supervised federated {IoT} malware detection framework based on knowledge transfer technologies, named by {FedMalDE}. Specifically, {FedMalDE} explores the underlying correlation between labeled and unlabeled records to infer labels towards unlabeled samples by the knowledge transfer mechanism. Moreover, a specially designed subgraph aggregated capsule network ({SACN}) is used to efficiently capture varied malicious behaviors. The extensive experiments conducted on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of {FedMalDE} in detecting {IoT} malware and its sufficient privacy and robustness guarantee.},

Next, we propose a dynamic intrusion response solution to maximize the attack defense performance while minimizing the negative impact on benign trafﬁc forwarding and the policy deployment cost in the {SDN} data plane. Then, we model the intrusion response system based on a Markov decision process ({MDP}) approach and formulate the related optimization problem. Afterward, we develop a Double Deep Q-Network based intrusion response control algorithm to assist the intrusion response system to quickly obtain the optimal intrusion response policy. In our case study, we consider denial-of-service ({DoS}) attacks—the performance evaluation results demonstrate that {DeepAir} can effectively prevent malicious packets from arriving at the victim in all considered {DoS} attack scenarios, i.e., approximately 85\% of attack packets are dropped. Moreover, by applying the optimal intrusion response policy, {DeepAir} can signiﬁcantly reduce the ratio of Quality-of-Service violated trafﬁc ﬂows compared to a Qlearning based approach (by 70\%), and to two existing solutions, i.e., {GATE} (by 75\%) and {GTAC}-{IRS} (by 80\%), respectively.},

	abstract = {The adoption of machine learning and deep learning is on the rise in the cybersecurity domain where these {AI} methods help strengthen traditional system monitoring and threat detection solutions. However, adversaries too are becoming more effective in concealing malicious behavior amongst large amounts of benign behavior data. To address the increasing time-to-detection of these stealthy attacks, interconnected and federated learning systems can improve the detection of malicious behavior by joining forces and pooling together monitoring data. The major challenge that we address in this work is that in a federated learning setup, an adversary has many more opportunities to poison one of the local machine learning models with malicious training samples, thereby inﬂuencing the outcome of the federated learning and evading detection. We present a solution where contributing parties in federated learning can be held accountable and have their model updates audited. We describe a permissioned blockchain-based federated learning method where incremental updates to an anomaly detection machine learning model are chained together on the distributed ledger. By integrating federated learning with blockchain technology, our solution supports the auditing of machine learning models without the necessity to centralize the training data. Experiments with a realistic intrusion detection use case and an autoencoder for anomaly detection illustrate that the increased complexity caused by blockchain technology has a limited performance impact on the federated learning, varying between 5 and 15\%, while providing full transparency over the distributed training process of the neural network. Furthermore, our blockchain-based federated learning solution can be generalized and applied to more sophisticated neural network architectures and other use cases.},

Deep learning methods are commonly used for the anomaly detection engines of many {IDSs} because of their ability to learn from heterogeneous data. However, while this type of machine learning model produces high false-positive rates and the reasons behind its predictions are not easily understood, even by experts. The ability to understand or comprehend the reasoning behind the decision of an {IDS} to block a particular packet helps cybersecurity experts validate the system’s effectiveness and develop more cyber-resilient systems.

The paper research construction of an intrusion detection system that ensures the confidentiality of critical data at a given level of intrusion detection accuracy. For this goal, federated learning is used to train an intrusion detection model. Federated learning is a computational model for distributed machine learning that allows different collaborating entities to train one global model without sharing data. This paper considers the case when entities have data that are different in attributes. Authors believe that it is a common situation for the critical systems constructed using Internet of Things ({IoT}) technology, when industrial objects are monitored by different sets of sensors. To evaluate the applicability of the federated learning for this case, the authors developed an approach and an architecture of the intrusion detection system for vertically partitioned data that consider the principles of federated learning and conducted the series of experiments. To model vertically partitioned data, the authors used the Secure Water Treatment ({SWaT}) data set that describes the functioning of the water treatment facility. The conducted experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of the intrusion detection model trained using federated learning is compared with the accuracy of the intrusion detection model trained using the centralized machine learning model. However, the computational efficiency of the learning and inference process is currently extremely low. It is explained by the application of homomorphic encryption for input data protection from different data owners or data sources. This defines the necessity to elaborate techniques for generating attributes that could model horizontally partitioned data even for the cases when the collaborating entities share datasets that differ in their attributes.},

However, these devices possess various security ﬂaws resulting from the lack of defense mechanisms and hardware security support, therefore making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, {IoT} gateways provide very limited security features to detect such threats, especially the absence of intrusion detection methods powered by deep learning. Indeed, deep learning models require high computational power that exceeds the capacity of these gateways. In this paper, we introduce Realguard, an {DNN}-based network intrusion detection system ({NIDS}) directly operated on local gateways to protect {IoT} devices within the network. The superiority of our proposal is that it can accurately detect multiple cyber attacks in real time with a small computational footprint. This is achieved by a lightweight feature extraction mechanism and an efﬁcient attack detection model powered by deep neural networks. Our evaluations on practical datasets indicate that Realguard could detect ten types of attacks (e.g., port scan, Botnet, and {FTP}-Patator) in real time with an average accuracy of 99.57\%, whereas the best of our competitors is 98.85\%. Furthermore, our proposal effectively operates on resource-constraint gateways (Raspberry {PI}) at a high packet processing rate reported about 10.600 packets per second.},

	abstract = {Recently, a number of backdoor attacks against Federated Learning ({FL}) have been proposed. In such attacks, an adversary injects poisoned model updates into the federated model aggregation process with the goal of manipulating the aggregated model to provide false predictions on speciﬁc adversary-chosen inputs. A number of defenses have been proposed but none of them can effectively protect the {FL} process also against so-called multi-backdoor attacks in which multiple different backdoors are injected by the adversary simultaneously without severely impacting the benign performance of the aggregated model. To overcome this challenge, we introduce {FLGUARD}, a poisoning defense framework that is able to defend {FL} against state-ofthe-art backdoor attacks while simultaneously maintaining the benign performance of the aggregated model. Moreover, {FL} is also vulnerable to inference attacks, in which a malicious aggregator can infer information about clients’ training data from their model updates. To thwart such attacks, we augment {FLGUARD} with state-of-the-art secure computation techniques that securely evaluate the {FLGUARD} algorithm. We provide formal argumentation for the effectiveness of our {FLGUARD} and extensively evaluate it against known backdoor attacks on several datasets and applications (including image classiﬁcation, word prediction, and {IoT} intrusion detection) demonstrating that {FLGUARD} can entirely remove backdoors with a negligible effect on accuracy. We also show that private {FLGUARD} achieves practical runtimes.},

Fog computing faces several issues such as latency, bandwidth, and link utilization due to limited resources and the high processing demands of end devices. To this end, fog caching plays an imperative role in addressing data dissemination issues. This study provides a comprehensive discussion of fog computing, Internet of Things ({IoTs}) and the critical issues related to data security and dissemination in fog computing.

Within a network, {IoT} devices are interdependent, and the behaviour of one device depends on the data coming from another device. An intruder exploits vulnerabilities of a device’s interdependent feature and can alter the telemetry data to indirectly control the behaviour of other dependent devices in a network. Therefore, securing {IoT} devices have become a signiﬁcant concern in {IoT} networks. The research community often proposes intrusion Detection Systems ({IDS}) using diﬀerent techniques. One of the most adopted techniques is machine learning ({ML}) based intrusion detection. This study suggests a stacking-based ensemble model makes {IoT} devices more intelligent for detecting unusual behaviour in {IoT} networks. The {TON}-{IoT} (2020) dataset is used to assess the eﬀectiveness of the proposed model.

	abstract = {Federated learning has emerged recently as a promising solution for distributing machine learning tasks through modern networks of mobile devices. Recent studies have obtained lower bounds on the expected decrease in model loss that is achieved through each round of federated learning. However, convergence generally requires a large number of communication rounds, which induces delay in model training and is costly in terms of network resources. In this paper, we propose a fast-convergent federated learning algorithm, called {FOLB}, which performs intelligent sampling of devices in each round of model training to optimize the expected convergence speed. We ﬁrst theoretically characterize a lower bound on improvement that can be obtained in each round if devices are selected according to the expected improvement their local models will provide to the current global model. Then, we show that {FOLB} obtains this bound through uniform sampling by weighting device updates according to their gradient information. {FOLB} is able to handle both communication and computation heterogeneity of devices by adapting the aggregations according to estimates of device’s capabilities of contributing to the updates. We evaluate {FOLB} in comparison with existing federated learning algorithms and experimentally show its improvement in trained model accuracy, convergence speed, and/or model stability across various machine learning tasks and datasets.},

Moving Target Defense ({MTD}) is a cyberdefense paradigm, successfully implemented in conventional systems, that could improve {IoT} security. Objective: Identify and synthesize existing {MTD} techniques for {IoT} and validate the feasibility of {MTD} as a cybersecurity paradigm suitable for {IoT} systems. Method: We use a systematic literature review method to search and analyze existing {MTD} for {IoT} techniques up to July 2020. We evaluated the existing techniques in terms of security foundations and real-world deployability using the evidence they provide. We define and use entropy-related metrics to categorize them. This is the first {MTD} survey to use Shannon\&\#x2019;s entropy metric empirically. Results: Thirty-two distinct {MTD} for {IoT} techniques exist: 54\% are Network-layer-based, 50\% present strong evidence about their real-world deployment, and 64\% have weak security foundations. Conclusion: {MTD} for {IoT} is a feasible cyberdefense approach. A variety of proposals exist, with evidence about their implementation and evaluation. Nevertheless, the {MTD} for {IoT} state of the art is still immature: the security foundations of most existing proposals are weak. Novel techniques should prioritize providing convincing security foundations and real-world deployment evidence.},

In this context, we initially provide a comprehensive classification of state-of-the-art surveys, which address various dimensions of the {IoT} paradigm. This aims at facilitating {IoT} research endeavors by amalgamating, comparing, and contrasting dispersed research contributions. Subsequently, we provide a unique taxonomy, which sheds the light on {IoT} vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts on numerous security objectives, attacks which exploit such vulnerabilities, corresponding remediation methodologies and currently offered operational cyber security capabilities to infer and monitor such weaknesses. This aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research perspective related to {IoT} vulnerabilities, including their technical details and consequences, which is postulated to be leveraged for remediation objectives. Additionally, motivated by the lack of empirical (and malicious) data related to the {IoT} paradigm, this paper also presents a first look on Internet-scale {IoT} exploitations by drawing upon more than 1.2 {GB} of macroscopic, passive measurements' data. This aims at practically highlighting the severity of the {IoT} problem, while providing operational situational awareness capabilities, which undoubtedly would aid in the mitigation task, at large.

While, {AI} techniques are based on data sharing among the vehicles, it is important to note that sensitive data cannot be shared. Thus, federated learning ({FL}) has been implemented to protect privacy in vehicles. On the other hand, the integrity of data and the safety of aggregation are ensured by using blockchain technology. This paper applied classification approaches to {VANET} and {ITS} cyber-threats detection at the vehicle. Subsequently, by using blockchain and by applying an aggregation strategy to different models, models from the previous step were uploaded in a smart contract. Lastly, we returned the updated models to the vehicles. Furthermore, we conducted an experimental study to measure the effectiveness of the proposed prototype. In this paper, the {VeReMi} data set was distributed in a balanced manner into five parts in the experimental study. Thus, classification techniques were executed by each vehicle separately, and models were generated. Upon the aggregation of the models in blockchain, they were returned to the vehicles. Lastly, the vehicles updated their decision functions and accessed the precision and accuracy of cyber-threat detection. The results indicated that the precision and accuracy decreased by 7.1\% on average with comparable F1-score and recall. Our solution ensures the privacy preservation of vehicles whereas blockchain guarantees the safety of aggregation technique and low gas consumption.},

	abstract = {As Internet trafﬁc classiﬁcation is a typical problem for {ISPs} or mobile carriers, there have been a lot of studies based on statistical packet header information, deep packet inspection, or machine learning. Due to recent advances in end-to-end encryption and dynamic port policies, machine or deep learning has been an essential key to improve the accuracy of packet classiﬁcation. In addition, {ISPs} or mobile carriers should carefully deal with the privacy issue while collecting user packets for accounting or security. The recent development of distributed machine learning, called federated learning, collaboratively carries out machine learning jobs on the clients without uploading data to a central server. Although federated learning provides an on-device learning framework towards user privacy protection, its feasibility and performance of Internet trafﬁc classiﬁcation have not been fully examined. In this paper, we propose a federated-learning trafﬁc classiﬁcation protocol ({FLIC}), which can achieve an accuracy comparable to centralized deep learning for Internet application identiﬁcation without privacy leakage. {FLIC} can classify new applications on-the-ﬂy when a participant joins in learning with a new application, which has not been done in previous works. By implementing the prototype of {FLIC} clients and a server with {TensorFlow}, the clients gather packets, perform the on-device training job and exchange the training results with the {FLIC} server. In addition, we demonstrate that federated learning-based packet classiﬁcation achieves an accuracy of 88\% under non-independent and identically distributed (non-{IID}) trafﬁc across clients. When a new application that can be classiﬁed dynamically as a client participates in learning was added, an accuracy of 92\% was achieved.},

	doi = {10/gmhhmw},
	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) is made up of billions of physical devices connected to the Internet via networks that perform tasks independently with less human intervention. Such brilliant automation of mundane tasks requires a considerable amount of user data in digital format, which in turn makes {IoT} networks an open-source of Personally Identifiable Information data for malicious attackers to steal, manipulate and perform nefarious activities. Huge interest has developed over the past years in applying machine learning ({ML})-assisted approaches in the {IoT} security space. However, the assumption in many current works is that big training data is widely available and transferable to the main server because data is born at the edge and is generated continuously by {IoT} devices. This is to say that classic {ML} works on the legacy set of entire data located on a central server, which makes it the least preferred option for domains with privacy concerns on user data. To address this issue, we propose federated learning ({FL})-based anomaly detection approach to proactively recognize intrusion in {IoT} networks using decentralized on-device data. Our approach uses federated training rounds on Gated Recurrent Units ({GRUs}) models and keeps the data intact on local {IoT} devices by sharing only the learned weights with the central server of the {FL}. Also, the approach’s ensembler part aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the global {ML} model’s accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the classic/centralized machine learning (non-{FL}) versions in securing the privacy of user data and provides an optimal accuracy rate in attack detection.},

To advance the state of the research in this area and to realize extensive utilization of the {FL} approach and its mass adoption, its security and privacy concerns must be first identified, evaluated, and documented. {FL} is preferred in use-cases where security and privacy are the key concerns and having a clear view and understanding of risk factors enable an implementer/adopter of {FL} to successfully build a secure environment and gives researchers a clear vision on possible research areas. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study concerning {FL}'s security and privacy aspects that can help bridge the gap between the current state of federated {AI} and a future in which mass adoption is possible. We present an illustrative description of approaches and various implementation styles with an examination of the current challenges in {FL} and establish a detailed review of security and privacy concerns that need to be considered in a thorough and clear context. Findings from our study suggest that overall there are fewer privacy-specific threats associated with {FL} compared to security threats. The most specific security threats currently are communication bottlenecks, poisoning, and backdoor attacks while inference-based attacks are the most critical to the privacy of {FL}.

Industry 4.0 includes the integration of cyber-physical systems ({CPSs}), Internet of Things ({IoT}), cloud and fog computing paradigms for developing smart systems, smart homes, and smart cities. Given Industry 4.0 is comprised sensor fields, actuators, fog and cloud processing paradigms, and network systems, designing a secure architecture faces two major challenges: handling heterogeneous sources at scale and maintaining security over a large, disparate, data-driven system that interacts with the physical environment. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme that models the dynamic interactions of industry 4.0 components including physical and network systems. The scheme consists of two components: a smart management module and a threat intelligence module. The smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one of the foundational requirements for interacting with an Industry 4.0 system. This includes data to and from sensors, actuators, in addition to other forms of network traffic. The proposed threat intelligence technique is designed based on beta mixture-hidden Markov models ({MHMMs}) for discovering anomalous activities against both physical and network systems. The scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the {CPS} dataset of sensors and actuators and the {UNSW}-{NB}15 dataset of network traffic. The results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms five peer mechanisms, suggesting its effectiveness as a viable deployment methodology in real-Industry 4.0 systems.},

The resource constrained resources in a smart home takes the advantages from a centralized manager which generates shared keys to transmit data, process every incoming and outgoing requests. The presented {ELIB} model generates an overlay network where highly equipped resources can merges to a public {BC} which verifies dedicated security and privacy. A set of three optimizations are carried out in the presented {ELIB} model include lightweight consensus algorithm, certificateless ({CC}) cryptography and Distributed Throughput Management ({DTM}) scheme. A detailed simulation takes place under different scenarios in terms of processing time, energy usage and overhead. The {ELIB} attains a total of 50\% saving in processing time on comparing to baseline method with the minimum energy consumption of 0.07mJ. The obtained experimental outcome indicated that the {ELIB} shows maximum performance under several evaluation parameters.},

Unfortunately, {PPFL} is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks launched by a Byzantine adversary, who crafts malicious local gradients to harm the accuracy of the federated model. To resist model poisoning attacks, existing defense strategies focus on identifying suspicious local gradients over plaintexts. However, the Byzantine adversary submits encrypted poisonous gradients to circumvent existing defense strategies in {PPFL}, resulting in encrypted model poisoning. To address the issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving defense strategy using two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption (referred to as {ShieldFL}), which can resist encrypted model poisoning without compromising privacy in {PPFL}. Specially, we ﬁrst present the secure cosine similarity method aiming to measure the distance between two encrypted gradients. Then, we propose the Byzantine-tolerance aggregation using cosine similarity, which can achieve robustness for both Independently Identically Distribution ({IID}) and non-{IID} data. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (i.e., {MNIST}, {KDDCup}99, and Amazon) show that {ShieldFL} outperforms existing defense strategies. Especially, {ShieldFL} can achieve 30\%−80\% accuracy improvement to defend two state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks in both non-{IID} and {IID} settings.},

However, for its independent devices, heterogeneous data and unbalanced data distribution, it is more vulnerable to adversarial attack, especially backdoor attack. In this paper, we investigate typical backdoor attacks in {FL}, containing model replacement attack and adaptive backdoor attack. Based on attack initiating round, we divide backdoor attack into convergence-round attack and early-round attack. In addition, we respectively design a defense scheme with model pre-aggregation and similarity measurement to detect and remove backdoor model under convergence-round attack and a defense scheme with backdoor neuron activation to remove backdoor under early-round attack. Experiments and performance analysis show that compared to benchmark schemes, our defense scheme with similarity measurement obtains the highest backdoor detection accuracy under model replacement attack (25\% increase) and adaptive backdoor attack (67\% increase) at the convergence round. Moreover, detection effect is the most stable. Compared to defense of participant-level differential privacy and adversarial training, our defense scheme with backdoor neuron activation can rapidly remove malicious effects of backdoor without reducing the main task accuracy under early-round attack. Thus, the robustness of {FL} can be improved greatly with our defense schemes. We make our key codes public at Github https://github.com/lsw3130104597/Backdoor\_detection.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is a type of distributed machine learning approacs that trains global models through the collaboration of participants. It protects data privacy as participants only contribute local models instead of sharing private local data. However, the performance of {FL} highly relies on the number of participants and their contributions. When applying {FL} over conventional computer networks, attracting more participants, encouraging participants to contribute more local resources, and enabling efﬁcient and effective collaboration among participants become very challenging. As software-deﬁned networks ({SDNs}) enable open and ﬂexible networking architecture with separate control and data planes, {SDNs} provide standardized protocols and speciﬁcations to enable ﬁne-grained collaborations among devices. Applying {FL} approaches over {SDNs} can take use such advantages to address challenges. A {SDN} control plane can have multiple controllers organized in layers; the controllers in the lower layer can be placed in the network edge to deal with the asymmetries in the attached switches and hosts, and the controller in the upper layer can supervise the whole network centrally and globally. Applying {FL} in {SDNs} with a layered-distributed control plane may be able to protect the data privacy of each participant while improving collaboration among participants to produce higher-quality models over asymmetric networks. Accordingly, this paper aims to make a comprehensive survey on the related mechanisms and solutions that enable {FL} in {SDNs}. It highlights three major challenges, an incentive mechanism, privacy and security, and model aggregation, which affect the quality and quantity of participants, the security and privacy in model transferring, and the performance of the global model, respectively. The state of the art in mechanisms and solutions that can be applied to address such challenges in the current literature are categorized based on the challenges they face, followed by suggestions of future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst effort in surveying the state of the art in combining {FL} with {SDNs}.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of data silos and popular privacy awareness, the traditional centralized approach of training artificial intelligence ({AI}) models is facing strong challenges. Federated learning ({FL}) has recently emerged as a promising solution under this new reality. Existing {FL} protocol design has been shown to exhibit vulnerabilities which can be exploited by adversaries both within and without the system to compromise data privacy. It is thus of paramount importance to make {FL} system designers to be aware of the implications of future {FL} algorithm design on privacy-preservation. Currently, there is no survey on this topic. In this paper, we bridge this important gap in {FL} literature. By providing a concise introduction to the concept of {FL}, and a unique taxonomy covering threat models and two major attacks on {FL}: 1) poisoning attacks and 2) inference attacks, this paper provides an accessible review of this important topic. We highlight the intuitions, key techniques as well as fundamental assumptions adopted by various attacks, and discuss promising future research directions towards more robust privacy preservation in {FL}.},

Hierarchical {FL}, with a client-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, can effectively leverage both the cloud server’s access to many clients’ data and the edge servers’ closeness to the clients to achieve a high communication efficiency. Neural network quantization can further reduce the communication overhead during model uploading. To fully exploit the advantages of hierarchical {FL}, an accurate convergence analysis with respect to the key system parameters is needed. Unfortunately, existing analysis is loose and does not consider model quantization. In this paper, we derive a tighter convergence bound for hierarchical {FL} with quantization. The convergence result leads to practical guidelines for important design problems such as the client-edge aggregation and edge-client association strategies. Based on the obtained analytical results, we optimize the two aggregation intervals and show that the client-edge aggregation interval should slowly decay while the edge-cloud aggregation interval needs to adapt to the ratio of the client-edge and edge-cloud propagation delay. Simulation results shall verify the design guidelines and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation strategy.},

To learn and distinguish between normal and malicious behavior, we use machine learning algorithms and train three typical models on three kinds of datasets: system logs, packet flows and host statistics. Unlike other studies, our study captures and monitors the behavior from multiple data sources in order to catch security attacks. Our aim is to figure out how to build the most effective dataset for machine learning with a combination of multiple sources. However, since there are no such datasets which have been generated from multiple sources for given attacks, we show how to build and generate a dataset with three data sources. We then compare the F1 score of the detection by applying machine learning algorithms for various combinations of the data sources. Our evaluation results show that the dataset of host statistics results in better performance (0.91) than traffic flows (0.63) and system logs (0.44) because it has the highest average F1-score in the three stages of attacks, while the other datasets may have poor F1-scores in some of the stages, particularly in the stage of impact. However, in the initial access stage of attacks, the dataset of logs performs the best (0.94), and the packet flows are suitable for detecting network {DoS} attacks (0.82). Furthermore, running this detection with all three data sources results in minor overheads of at most 2.1\% {CPU} utilization. Finally, we analyze the important features of each model, such as the number of logs generated by apache-access, in.telnetd and postfix in the dataset of logs, {SrcBytes} and {TotBytes} in the dataset of flows, and {MINFLT}, {VSTEXT} and {RSIZE} in the dataset of statistics.},

	abstract = {As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things ({IoT}) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System ({MTS}). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent {IoT} devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of {IoT}-based {MTS} and propose a {CNN}-{MLP} based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named {FedBatch}. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) and Multi-Layer Perception ({MLP}) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in {MTS}, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the {NSL}-{KDD} dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of {FedBatch}.},

Machine learning methods can automatically discover the essential differences between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability, so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a taxonomy of {IDS} that takes data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep learning-based {IDS} literature. We believe that this type of taxonomy framework is ﬁt for cyber security researchers. The survey ﬁrst clariﬁes the concept and taxonomy of {IDSs}. Then, the machine learning algorithms frequently used in {IDSs}, metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced. Next, combined with the representative literature, we take the proposed taxonomic system as a baseline and explain how to solve key {IDS} issues with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Finally, challenges and future developments are discussed by reviewing recent representative studies.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning ({FL}) is a novel distributed machine learning, which allows thousands of edge devices to train models locally without uploading data to the central server. Since devices in real federated settings are resource-constrained, {FL} encounters systems heterogeneity, which causes considerable stragglers and incurs significant accuracy degradation. To tackle the challenges of systems heterogeneity and improve the robustness of the global model, we propose a novel adaptive federated framework in this paper. Specifically, we propose {FedSAE} that leverages the workload completion history of clients to adaptively predict the affordable training workload for each device. Consequently, {FedSAE} can significantly reduce stragglers in highly heterogeneous systems. We incorporate Active Learning into {FedSAE} to dynamically schedule participants. The server evaluates the devices’ training value based on their training loss in each round, and larger-value clients are selected with a higher probability. As a result, the model convergence is accelerated. Furthermore, we propose q-{FedSAE} that combines {FedSAE} and q-{FFL} to improve global fairness in highly heterogeneous systems. The evaluations conducted in a highly heterogeneous system demonstrate that both {FedSAE} and q-{FedSAE} converge faster than {FedAvg}. In particular, {FedSAE} outperforms {FedAvg} across multiple federated datasets — {FedSAE} improves testing accuracy by 22.19\% and reduces stragglers by 90.69\% on average. Moreover, holding the same accuracy as {FedSAE}, q-{FedSAE} allows for more robust convergence and fairer model performance than q-{FedAvg}, {FedSAE}.},

	abstract = {An advanced metering infrastructure ({AMI}) system plays a key role in the smart grid ({SG}), but it is vulnerable to cyberattacks. Current detection methods for {AMI} cyberattacks mainly focus on the data center or a distributed independent node. On one hand, it is difficult to train an excellent detection intrusion model on a self-learning independent node. On the other hand, large amounts of data are shared over the network and uploaded to a central node for training. These processes may compromise data privacy, cause communication delay, and incur high communication costs. With these limitations, we propose a federated learning ({FL}) based intrusion detection method for {AMI} systems. In this method, the intrusion detection model is deployed in the data concentrators for training, and only its model parameters are communicated to the data center. Furthermore, the data center distributes the learning to each data concentrator through aggregation and weight assignments for collaborative learning. An optimized deep neural network ({DNN}) is exploited for this method, and extensive experiments based on the {NSL}-{KDD} dataset are carried out. From the results, this method improves detection performance and reduces computational costs, communication delays, and communication overheads while guaranteeing data privacy.},

Consequently, the machine learning based intrusion detection model has to update to cope with new attacks. However, existing machine learning based {IoV} intrusion detection schemes require large amounts of labeled data to complete model updates. For new attacks, the {IoV} cloud is also difﬁcult to identify in time, which requires a lot of labor and time cost in {IoV}. To solve above issue, this paper employs transfer learning and proposes two model update schemes based on whether the {IoV} cloud can timely provide a small amount of labeled data for a new attack. The ﬁrst one is the cloud-assisted update scheme where the {IoV} cloud can provide a small amount of data. And the second one is the local update scheme where the {IoV} cloud cannot provide any labeled data timely. In this paper, the local update scheme obtains pseudo label of the unlabeled data in new attacks via pre-classiﬁes and uses the pseudo-labeled data for multiple rounds of transfer learning. Then the vehicle can complete the update without obtaining any labeled data through the {IoV} cloud. The experimental results show that compared with the existing method, our two schemes have improved the detection accuracy by at least 23\%.},

Despite the enhanced performance and efﬁciency of {HFL} over local training, clues for inspecting the behaviors of the participating clients and the federated model are usually lacking due to the privacy-preserving nature of {HFL}. Consequently, the users can only conduct a shallow-level analysis of potential abnormal behaviors and have limited means to assess the contributions of individual clients and implement the necessary intervention. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate the {HFL} process inspection, usually by providing model metrics and evaluation results as a dashboard representation. Although the existing visualization methods allow a simple examination of the {HFL} model performance, they cannot support the intensive exploration of the {HFL} process. In this study, strictly following the {HFL} privacy-preserving protocol, we design an exploratory visual analytics system for the {HFL} process termed {HFLens}, which supports comparative visual interpretation at the overview, communication round, and client instance levels. Speciﬁcally, the proposed system facilitates the investigation of the overall process involving all clients, the correlation analysis of clients’ information in one or different communication round(s), the identiﬁcation of potential anomalies, and the contribution assessment of each {HFL} client. Two case studies conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of our system. Experts’ feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps in understanding and diagnosing the {HFL} process better.},

In this work, we introduce a framework, {FedProx}, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. {FedProx} can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of {FedAvg}, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modiﬁcations to the method itself, these modiﬁcations have important ramiﬁcations both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that {FedProx} allows for more robust convergence than {FedAvg} across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, {FedProx} demonstrates signiﬁcantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to {FedAvg}—improving absolute test accuracy by 22\% on average.},

Network Intrusion Detection System ({NIDS}) is intended to provide a high level of protection for modern network environments, but how to implement distributed {NIDS} on {STINs} has not been widely discussed. At the same time, satellite networks have always lacked real and effective security data sets as references. To solve these problems, we propose a distributed {NIDS} using Federal Learning ({FL}) in {STIN} to properly allocate resources in each domain to analyze and block malicious trafﬁc, especially distributed denial-of-service ({DDoS}) attacks. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst design a typical {STIN} topology, on the basis of which we collect and design security data sets adapted to satellite and terrestrial networks in {STIN}, respectively. To address the problem of poor attack resistance of satellite networks, we propose a satellite network topology optimization algorithm to reduce the difﬁculty in tracing malicious packets due to frequent link switching. In order to solve the problem of limited resources and high privacy requirements of satellite networks, we propose an algorithm for {FL} adaptation to {STIN}, and build a distributed {NIDS} using {FL} in {STIN}. Finally, we deploy the designed distributed {NIDS} in a prototype system and evaluate our proposed distributed {NIDS} with a large number of simulations of randomly generated malicious trafﬁc. Related results demonstrate that the performance of our approach is better than traditional deep learning and intrusion detection methods in terms of malicious trafﬁc recognition rate, packet loss rate, and {CPU} utilization.},

However, existing logbased anomaly detection approaches that are implemented on large-scale Internet of Things ({IoT}) systems generally upload the local data from the edge devices to a centralized (cloud) server for processing and analysis. Such a workﬂow incurs signiﬁcant communication and computation overheads, with potential privacy implications. Hence, in this paper, we propose a customizable and communication-efﬁcient federated anomaly detection scheme (hereafter referred to as {FedLog}), designed to facilitate the identiﬁcation of abnormal log patterns in large-scale {IoT} systems. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst craft a Temporal Convolutional Network-Attention Mechanism-based Convolutional Neural Network ({TCN}-{ACNN}) model, to effectively extract ﬁne-grained features from system logs.

Third, a lottery ticket hypothesis based masking strategy is designed to achieve customizable and communication-efﬁcient federated learning in handling {nonIndependent} and Identically Distributed (non-{IID}) log datasets. We then evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme with those of {DeepLog} (published in {CCS}, 2017) and Loganomaly (published in {IJCAI}, 2019) in both centralized learning and federated learning settings, using two publicly available and widely used real-world datasets (i.e., {HDFS} and {BGL}).

	abstract = {Distributed denial-of-service attacks are a kind of malicious attempts among many others that make target services unavailable to legitimate users by using a large number of bots, which send many service requests exceeding the processing capacity of the services. Detection of botnet traffic is therefore critical to maintaining the availability and quality of the services. In contrast, identifying the type of botnet attacks helps system administrators quickly determine which part of the computer and network system is under attack. Current works focus on rule-based detection, which sets rules in the network firewall to drop suspicious traffic that matches the rules. With the emergence of machine learning and deep learning ({ML}/{DL}), several preliminary works have been developed to learn botnet traffic behavior and perform detection. However, the performance of existing {ML}/{DL} models can be further improved and their decision/prediction are not transparent, making it hard for users to interpret and trust the results. In this work, we develop a novel deep learning model for botnet detection and classification combined with its ability of explaining the decision of the model. We first leverage latent representation of traffic features generated using convolutional neural networks to detect whether a traffic record is generated by a bot then determine the type of bots. We adopt an existing explainable framework to interpret the prediction of the developed deep learning model. We perform extensive experiments with real network traffic as well as synthetic traffic generated by {IXIA} {BreakingPoint} System. We compare the developed model with existing models on various performance metrics. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms the existing machine learning models with an improvement of up to {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater}{\textless}tex-math notation="{LaTeX}"{\textgreater}\$15\%\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}{\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} for all performance metrics while providing a clear explanation of the model decision.},

	abstract = {We study online privacy-preserving anomaly detection in a setting in which the data are distributed over a network and locally sensitive to each node, and a probabilistic data model is unknown. We design and analyze a data-driven solution scheme where each node observes a high-dimensional data stream for which it computes a local outlierness score. This score is then perturbed, encrypted, and sent to a network operator. The network operator then decrypts an aggregate statistic over the network and performs online network anomaly detection via the proposed generalized cumulative sum ({CUSUM}) algorithm. We derive an asymptotic lower bound and an asymptotic approximation for the average false alarm period of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, we derive an asymptotic upper bound and asymptotic approximation for the average detection delay of the proposed algorithm under a certain anomaly. We show the analytical tradeoff between the anomaly detection performance and the differential privacy level, controlled via the local perturbation noise. Experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm offers a good tradeoff between privacy and quick anomaly detection against the {UDP} ﬂooding and spam attacks in a real Internet of Things ({IoT}) network.},

The integration of Digital Twin ({DT}) with {IIoT} digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, {DT} empowered {IIoT} generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning ({DL}) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in {IIoT} network. The framework first present a new {DT} model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of {IIoT}. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the {DL} scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In {DL} scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse {AutoEncoder} ({LSTMSAE}) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention ({MHSA})-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit ({BiGRU}) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) is emerging as a new technology for the development of various critical applications. However, these applications are still working on centralized storage architecture and have various key challenges like privacy, security, and single point of failure. Recently, the blockchain technology has emerged as a backbone for the {IoT}-based application development. The blockchain can be leveraged to solve privacy, security, and single point of failure (third-part dependency) issues of {IoT} applications. The integration of blockchain with {IoT} can beneﬁt both individual and society. However, 2017 Distributed Denial of Service ({DDoS}) attack on mining pool exposed the critical fault-lines among blockchain-enabled {IoT} network. Moreover, these application generates huge amount of data. Machine Learning ({ML}) gives complete autonomy in big data analysis, capabilities of decision making and therefore is used as an analytical tool. Thus, in order to address above challenges, this paper proposes a novel distributed Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) using fog computing to detect {DDoS} attacks against mining pool in blockchain-enabled {IoT} Network. The performance is evaluated by training Random Forest ({RF}) and an optimized gradient tree boosting system ({XGBoost}) on distributed fog nodes. The proposed model e↵ectiveness is assessed using an actual {IoT}-based dataset i.e., {BoT}-{IoT}, which includes most recent attacks found in blockchain-enabled {IoT} network. The results indicate, for binary attack-detection {XGBoost} outperforms whereas for multi-attack detection Random Forest outperforms. Overall on distributed fog nodes {RF} takes less time for training and testing compared to {XGBoost}.},

To address this challenge, realistic protection and investigation countermeasures, such as network intrusion detection and network forensic systems, need to be effectively developed. For this purpose, a well-structured and representative dataset is paramount for training and validating the credibility of the systems. Although there are several network datasets, in most cases, not much information is given about the Botnet scenarios that were used. This paper proposes a new dataset, so-called Bot-{IoT}, which incorporates legitimate and simulated {IoT} network traffic, along with various types of attacks. We also present a realistic testbed environment for addressing the existing dataset drawbacks of capturing complete network information, accurate labeling, as well as recent and complex attack diversity. Finally, we evaluate the reliability of the {BoT}-{IoT} dataset using different statistical and machine learning methods for forensics purposes compared with the benchmark datasets. This work provides the baseline for allowing botnet identification across {IoT}-specific networks. The Bot-{IoT} dataset can be accessed at Bot-iot (2018) [1].},

	abstract = {We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal. A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of {\textbackslash}federated optimization.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a high-quality centralized model while training data remains distributed over a large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network connections. We consider learning algorithms for this setting where on each round, each client independently computes an update to the current model based on its local data, and communicates this update to a central server, where the client-side updates are aggregated to compute a new global model. The typical clients in this setting are mobile phones, and communication efficiency is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a random mask; and sketched updates, where we learn a full model update and then compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server. Experiments on both convolutional and recurrent networks show that the proposed methods can reduce the communication cost by two orders of magnitude.},

Methodology – In order to achieve these goals, we describe here an Android malware collection called Kharon.

We run them in a controlled and monitored real smartphone in order to extract their precise behavior. We also summarized their behavior using a graph representations of the information ﬂows induced by an execution. With such a process, we obtained a precise knowledge of their malicious code and actions. Results and conclusions – Researchers can ﬁgure out the engineering efforts of malware developers and understand their programming patterns. Another important result of this study is that most of malware now include triggering techniques that delay and hide their malicious activities.

In this context, the contribution of this paper is multifold. First, it gathers, categorizes, thoroughly evaluates the most popular attacks on 802.11 and analyzes their signatures. Second, it offers a publicly available dataset containing a rich blend of normal and attack traffic against 802.11 networks. A quite extensive first-hand evaluation of this dataset using several machine learning algorithms and data features is also provided. Given that to the best of our knowledge the literature lacks such a rich and well-tailored dataset, it is anticipated that the results of the work at hand will offer a solid basis for intrusion detection in the current as well as next-generation wireless networks.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning ({FL}) has recently become an effective approach for cyberattack detection systems, especially in Internet-of-Things ({IoT}) networks. By distributing the learning process across {IoT} gateways, {FL} can improve learning efﬁciency, reduce communication overheads and enhance privacy for cyberattack detection systems. Challenges in implementation of {FL} in such systems include unavailability of labeled data and dissimilarity of data features in different {IoT} networks. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative learning framework that leverages Transfer Learning ({TL}) to overcome these challenges. Particularly, we develop a novel collaborative learning approach that enables a target network with unlabeled data to effectively and quickly learn “knowledge” from a source network that possesses abundant labeled data. It is important that the stateof-the-art studies require the participated datasets of networks to have the same features, thus limiting the efﬁciency, ﬂexibility as well as scalability of intrusion detection systems. However, our proposed framework can address these problems by exchanging the learning “knowledge” among various deep learning models, even when their datasets have different features. Extensive experiments on recent real-world cybersecurity datasets show that the proposed framework can improve more than 40\% as compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches.},

The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body.

	abstract = {Federated learning, as a promising machine learning approach, has emerged to leverage a distributed personalized dataset from a number of nodes, for example, mobile devices, to improve performance while simultaneously providing privacy preservation for mobile users. In federated learning, training data is widely distributed and maintained on the mobile devices as workers. A central aggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile devices using their local training data to train the global model in each iteration. However, unreliable data may be uploaded by the mobile devices (i.e., workers), leading to frauds in tasks of federated learning. The workers may perform unreliable updates intentionally, for example, the data poisoning attack, or unintentionally, for example, low-quality data caused by energy constraints or high-speed mobility. Therefore, finding out trusted and reliable workers in federated learning tasks becomes critical. In this article, the concept of reputation is introduced as a metric. Based on this metric, a reliable worker selection scheme is proposed for federated learning tasks. Consortium blockchain is leveraged as a decentralized approach for achieving efficient reputation management of the workers without repudiation and tampering. By numerical analysis, the proposed approach is demonstrated to improve the reliability of federated learning tasks in mobile networks.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is an emerging machine learning technique that enables distributed model training using local datasets from large-scale nodes, e.g., mobile devices, but shares only model updates without uploading the raw training data. This technique provides a promising privacy preservation for mobile devices while simultaneously ensuring high learning performance. The majority of existing work has focused on designing advanced learning algorithms with an aim to achieve better learning performance. However, the challenges, such as incentive mechanisms for participating in training and worker (i.e., mobile devices) selection schemes for reliable federated learning, have not been explored yet. These challenges have hindered the widespread adoption of federated learning. To address the above challenges, in this article, we first introduce reputation as the metric to measure the reliability and trustworthiness of the mobile devices. We then design a reputation-based worker selection scheme for reliable federated learning by using a multiweight subjective logic model. We also leverage the blockchain to achieve secure reputation management for workers with nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties in a decentralized manner. Moreover, we propose an effective incentive mechanism combining reputation with contract theory to motivate high-reputation mobile devices with high-quality data to participate in model learning. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed schemes are efficient for reliable federated learning in terms of significantly improving the learning accuracy.},

	title = {Toward a Knowledge Graph of Cybersecurity Countermeasures},
	abstract = {This paper describes our research and development toward a precise, unambiguous, and information-dense knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures. In project work for our sponsors we have repeatedly encountered the need for a model that can identify and precisely specify cybersecurity countermeasure components and capabilities. Furthermore, it is necessary that practitioners know not only what threats a capability claims to address, but, speciﬁcally how those threats are addressed from an engineering perspective, and under what circumstances the solution would work. This knowledge is essential to estimate operational applicability, vulnerabilities, and develop enterprise solutions comprising multiple capabilities. To address this recurring need in the near-term, we created D3FEND, a framework in which we encode a countermeasure knowledge base, but more speciﬁcally, a knowledge graph. The graph contains semantically rigorous types and relations that deﬁne both the key concepts in the cybersecurity countermeasure domain and the relations necessary to link those concepts to each other. We ground each of the concepts and relations to particular references in the cybersecurity literature. Numerous sources of research and development literature were analyzed, including a targeted sample of over 500 countermeasure patents drawn from the U.S. Patent Ofﬁce corpus over the years 2001 to 2018. To demonstrate the value of this approach in practice, we describe how the graph supports queries that can inferentially map cybersecurity countermeasures to offensive {TTPs}. As part of a larger vision, we outline future D3FEND work to leverage the linked open data available on research literature and apply machine learning, in particular semi-supervised methods, to assist in maintaining the D3FEND knowledge graph over time. Finally, we welcome community feedback on D3FEND.},

However, road side units that primarily presume the role of vehicular edge computing servers cannot be fully trusted, which may lead to serious security and privacy challenges for such integrated platforms despite their promising potential and benefits. We exploit consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies to achieve secure data storage and sharing in vehicular edge networks. These technologies efficiently prevent data sharing without authorization. In addition, we propose a reputation-based data sharing scheme to ensure high-quality data sharing among vehicles. A three-weight subjective logic model is utilized for precisely managing reputation of the vehicles.

	abstract = {With the popularity of Android and its open source, the Android platform has become an attractive target for hackers, and the detection and classiﬁcation of malware has become a research hotspot. Existing malware classiﬁcation methods rely on complex manual operation or large-volume high-quality training data. However, malware data collected by security providers contains user privacy information, such as user identity and behavior habit information. The increasing concern for user privacy poses a challenge to the current malware classiﬁcation scheme. Based on this problem, we propose a new android malware classiﬁcation scheme based on Federated learning, named {FedHGCDroid}, which classiﬁes malware on Android clients in a privacy-protected manner. Firstly, we use a convolutional neural network and graph neural network to design a novel multi-dimensional malware classiﬁcation model {HGCDroid}, which can effectively extract malicious behavior features to classify the malware accurately. Secondly, we introduce an {FL} framework to enable distributed Android clients to collaboratively train a comprehensive Android malware classiﬁcation model in a privacy-preserving way. Finally, to adapt to the non-{IID} distribution of malware on Android clients, we propose a contribution degree-based adaptive classiﬁer training mechanism {FedAdapt} to improve the adaptability of the malware classiﬁer based on Federated learning. Comprehensive experimental studies on the Androzoo dataset (under different non-{IID} data settings) show that the {FedHGCDroid} achieves more adaptability and higher accuracy than the other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Many companies are increasingly making machine learning integral to their businesses. To defray the resulting compute costs, much work has proposed using preemptible cloud instances, a discount tier of virtual machine rentals that may be interrupted at the cloud provider’s discretion, to run machine learning jobs. However, processing data streams on preemptible instances presents new challenges: processing data points as they arrive may lead to bottlenecks when scaling the system to handle higher throughput, particularly if the instances are frequently interrupted. Ours is the first work to design, analyze, and optimize a system that trains a machine learning model on a set of data streams with online stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}) on preemptible instances. Our system, {DOLL}, uses queueing and batching to parallelize and scale {SGD} to large numbers of workers and incoming data streams, as well as heterogeneous data arrival rates across streams. An expected error convergence guarantee is then derived for {DOLL}’s training process. We use this guarantee to optimize the cost of requisitioning preemptible and on-demand instances in the face of a performance target and wall-clock time deadline; this optimization is validated on experiments demonstrating substantial cost savings with little impact on model error, compared to on-demand instances.},

A {DNA} encoding model is formed, which defines a mapping relationship between {NT} attributes and nucleobases to reconstruct {NT} samples expressed as {DNA} sequences. Then, a feature extraction algorithm is constructed that deduces a Spatial Information Feature Matrix ({SIFM}) to represent sequence statistical features. A Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm is adopted as a matching process to determine {NI} behaviors considering the detection efficiency. Following experiments evaluate its method performance on two datasets, {NSL}-{KDD} and {UNSW}-{NB}15. Results demonstrate that {DNA}-{SI} obtains better results than state-of-the-art works, where the accuracy, F1-score, recall, far are 95.75\%, 94.41\%, 94.12\%, 3.26\% and 92.30\%, 92.78\%, 89.82\%, 4.66\% respectively.

The fault detection model is initially trained in the server using historical data and updated using the parameters of local models from edge servers according to different updating strategies, then the parameters will be sent to each edge server and further to all terminals. Each edge server updates the local model via the compressed system log from terminals in its coverage region, and each terminal uses the model to detect fault according to the system behavior in the log. Experiment results show that this fault detection algorithm has high accuracy and low latency, and the accuracy increases with more model updating.},

	abstract = {Federated learning allows multiple participants to conduct joint modeling without disclosing their local data. Vertical federated learning ({VFL}) handles the situation where participants share the same {ID} space and different feature spaces. In most {VFL} frameworks, to protect the security and privacy of the participants’ local data, a third party is needed to generate homomorphic encryption key pairs and perform decryption operations. In this way, the third party is granted the right to decrypt information related to model parameters. However, it isn’t easy to ﬁnd such a credible entity in the real world. Existing methods for solving this problem are either communication-intensive or unsuitable for multi-party scenarios. By combining secret sharing and homomorphic encryption, we propose a novel {VFL} framework without a third party called {EFMVFL}, which supports ﬂexible expansion to multiple participants with low communication overhead and is applicable to generalized linear models. We give instantiations of our framework under logistic regression and Poisson regression.

	abstract = {Differential privacy ({DP}) is considered to be an effective privacy-preservation method to secure the promising distributed machine learning ({ML}) paradigm- federated learning ({FL}) from privacy attacks (e.g., membership inference attack). Nevertheless, while the {DP} mechanism greatly alleviates the privacy concerns, recent studies have shown that it can be exploited to conduct security attacks (e.g., false data injection attacks). To address such attacks on {FL}-based applications in critical infrastructures, in this paper, we perform the ﬁrst systematic study on the {DP}-exploited poisoning attacks from an adversarial point of view. We demonstrate that the {DP} method, despite providing a level of privacy guarantee, can effectively open a new poisoning attack vector for the adversary. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on a smart grid dataset show the {FL} performance degradation (sub-optimal model generation) scenario due to the differential noise-exploited selective model poisoning attacks. As a countermeasure, we propose a reinforcement learning-based differential privacy level selection ({rDP}) process. The {rDP} process utilizes the differential privacy parameters (privacy loss, information leakage probability, etc.) and the losses to intelligently generate an optimal privacy level for the nodes. The evaluation shows the accumulated reward and errors of the proposed technique converge to an optimal privacy policy.},

	abstract = {{WiFi} sensing using Channel State Information ({CSI}) offers a device-free and non-intrusive method for human activity monitoring. However, the data-hungry and location-specific training process hinders its scalable deployment at large sizes. In this work, we propose {WiFederated}, a federated learning ({FL}) approach to train machine learning models for {WiFi} sensing tasks. Using {WiFederated}, client devices can not only perform training in parallel at the edge instead of sequentially at a central server but can also collaboratively learn and share generalizable location-independent traits about physical actions being monitored. We demonstrate that an {FL} model trained on as few as 2-3 locations can provide high prediction accuracy in new locations even without any data available from them. We also demonstrate how new locations can achieve higher prediction accuracy even with a small number of available samples when using the pretrained {FL} model rather than training from scratch. The results show that the {FL} model can save local training epochs and reduce the need for large data collection at each new location. Thus, the proposed {WiFederated} system scales as more locations are added. We show that {WiFederated} provides a more accurate and time efficient solution compared to existing transfer learning and adversarial learning solutions thanks to the parallel training ability at multiple clients. By introducing new client selection methods during the {FL} process, we also show that accuracy can further increase. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of training models at the edge and introduce continuous annotation to allow for continuous learning over time.},

To compete in this environment, Industry 4.0 emerges as an essential alternative. In this context, the reliability of manufacturing is an essential aspect for companies to make successful decisions. In the literature, several technologies associated with Industry 4.0 have been applied to improve the availability of equipment, including the Internet of Things ({IoT}), Cyber-Physical Systems ({CPS}), blockchain, and data mining. Nevertheless, there is still no survey study that seeks to show how reliability has collaborated to support decision-making in organizations, in the context of Industry 4.0. In general, most applications still focus on the productivity and health of individual equipment. However, in today's volatile and complex businesses, local decisions are no longer sufficient; it is necessary to analyze the organization entirely. Thus, being aware of the impacts that a local failure can impose on the entire company has significant weight in the decision-making process. In this context, this article presents a survey to identify how researches on systems reliability has contributed to and supported the development of decision-making in Industry 4.0. The main contribution of this article is to highlight how reliability can be used to support different types of strategic decisions in the context of Industry 4.0. Finally, it highlights the need for research associating management decisions with the technologies of Industry 4.0.},

	title = {{CHFL}: A Collaborative Hierarchical Federated Intrusion Detection System for Vehicular Networks},
	abstract = {Wireless interfaces, remote control schemes, and increased autonomy have raised the attacks surface of vehicular networks. As powerful monitoring entities, intrusion detection systems ({IDS}) must be updated and customised to respond to emerging networks’ requirements. As server-based monitoring schemes were prone to signiﬁcant privacy concerns, new privacy constrained learning methods such as federated learning ({FL}) have received considerable attention in designing {IDS}. However, to alleviate the efﬁciency and enhance the scalability of the original {FL}, this paper proposes a novel collaborative hierarchical federated {IDS}, named {CHFL} for the vehicular network. In the {CHFL} model, a group of vehicles assisted by vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technologies can exchange intrusion detection information collaboratively in a private format. Each group nominates a leader, and the leading vehicle serves as the intermediate in the second level detection system of the hierarchical federated model. The leader communicates directly with the server to transmit and receive model updates of its nearby end vehicles. By reducing the number of direct communications to the server, our proposed system reduces network uplink trafﬁc and queuing-processing latency. In addition, {CHFL} improved the prediction loss and the accuracy of the whole system. We are achieving an accuracy of 99.10\% compared with 97.01\% accuracy of the original {FL}.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10677},
	abstract = {Consider two data providers, each maintaining private records of different feature sets about common entities. They aim to learn a linear model jointly in a federated setting, namely, data is local and a shared model is trained from locally computed updates. In contrast with most work on distributed learning, in this scenario (i) data is split vertically, i.e. by features, (ii) only one data provider knows the target variable and (iii) entities are not linked across the data providers. Hence, to the challenge of private learning, we add the potentially negative consequences of mistakes in entity resolution. Our contribution is twofold. First, we describe a three-party end-to-end solution in two phases—privacy-preserving entity resolution and federated logistic regression over messages encrypted with an additively homomorphic scheme—, secure against a honest-but-curious adversary. The system allows learning without either exposing data in the clear or sharing which entities the data providers have in common. Our implementation is as accurate as a naive non-private solution that brings all data in one place, and scales to problems with millions of entities with hundreds of features. Second, we provide what is to our knowledge the ﬁrst formal analysis of the impact of entity resolution’s mistakes on learning, with results on how optimal classiﬁers, empirical losses, margins and generalisation abilities are affected. Our results bring a clear and strong support for federated learning: under reasonable assumptions on the number and magnitude of entity resolution’s mistakes, it can be extremely beneﬁcial to carry out federated learning in the setting where each peer’s data provides a signiﬁcant uplift to the other.},

This has eventually caused many threats to the communication networks as well due to a more frequent generation of security attacks that are either novel or the mutation of the existing attacks. To secure the networks against such threats, an intrusion detection system ({IDS}) is considered as one of the promising solutions. The main problem with the {IDS} is its increased false alarm rate ({FAR}) in detecting the zero-day attacks. To improve the detection accuracy and minimizing the {FAR}, the researchers proposed {IDS} solutions using artificial intelligence ({AI}) approaches. In this research, we have systematically reviewed the recent {AI}-based network {IDS} ({NIDS}) solutions proposed during the period 2016–2021 by the research community. We systematically analysed the proposed {NIDS} solutions based on their strengths, shortcomings, {AI} methodology adopted, datasets, and the evaluation metrics used for evaluation purposes. From the review, we observed that the hybrid approach is mostly adopted by the researchers to propose {AI}-based {NIDS} solutions, with a trend shifting to deep learning-based approaches over the last 2 years. Also, most of the proposed solutions are evaluated using a very old dataset with only a few studies opting for the latest datasets. Finally based on our observations, we highlighted the research challenges and the future research directions to help young researchers to contribute to this field.},

	abstract = {Internet of Medical Things ({IoMT}) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things ({IoT}) technologies to sense patients’ vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support justin-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection ({AD}) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by signiﬁcant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients’ personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the {AD} model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized {AD} models, here we propose a Federated Learning ({FL}) based {AD} model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run {AD} models locally without sharing patients’ data. Since existing {FL} approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of {FL}, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical {FL} that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multiparty collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different {AD} models are grouped based on speciﬁc types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed ({FEDTIMEDIS}) Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) approach to train the {AD} model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring ({RPM}) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin ({DT}) and edge cloudlets.},

In order to achieve this, we extracted 39 features from network logs and discard any features containing redundant information. After feature selection, fuzzy C-Mean ({FCM}) algorithm was trained to obtain clusters discriminating benign traffic from malicious traffic. We studied the feature scores in these clusters and use this information to predict the type of new traffic flows. {IoT}-guard was evaluated using a real-world testbed with more than 30 devices. The results show that {IoTguard} achieves high accuracy (98\%), in differentiating various types of malicious and benign traffic, with low false positive rates. Furthermore, it has low resource footprint and can operate on {OpenWRT} enabled access points and {COTS} computing boards.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of the Internet of things ({IoT}) in diverse domains, security concerns and {IoT} threats are constantly rising. The computational and memory limitations of {IoT} devices have resulted in emerging vulnerabilities in most {IoT}-run environments. Due to the low processing ability, {IoT} devices are often not capable of running complex defensive mechanisms. Lack of an architecture for a safer {IoT} environment is referred to as the most important barrier in developing a secure {IoT} system. In this paper, we propose a secure architecture for {IoT} edge layer infrastructure, called {AI}4SAFE-{IoT}. This architecture is built upon {AI}-powered security modules at the edge layer for protecting {IoT} infrastructure. Cyber threat attribution, intelligent web application firewall, cyber threat hunting, and cyber threat intelligence are the main modules proposed in our architecture. The proposed modules detect, attribute, and further identify the stage of an attack life cycle based on the Cyber Kill Chain model. In the proposed architecture, we define each security module and show its functionality against different threats in real-world applications. Moreover, due to the integration of {AI} security modules in a different layer of {AI}4SAFE-{IoT}, each threat in the edge layer will be handled by its corresponding security module delivered by a service. We compared the proposed architecture with the existing models and discussed our architecture independence of the underlying {IoT} layer and its comparatively low overhead according to delivering security as service for the edge layer of {IoT} architecture instead of embed implementation. Overall, we evaluated our proposed architecture based on the {IoT} service management score. The proposed architecture obtained 84.7 out of 100 which is the highest score among peer {IoT} edge layer security architectures.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service ({DDoS}) attacks are the most common means of cyberattacks against infrastructure, and detection is the first step in combating them. The current {DDoS} detection mainly uses the improvement or fusion of machine learning and deep learning methods to improve classification performance. However, most classifiers are trained with statistical flow features as input, ignoring topological connection changes. This one-sidedness affects the detection accuracy and cannot provide a basis for the distribution of attack sources for defense deployment. In this study, we propose a topological and flow feature-based deep learning method ({GLD}-Net), which simultaneously extracts flow and topological features from time-series flow data and exploits graph attention network ({GAT}) to mine correlations between non-Euclidean features to fuse flow and topological features. The long short-term memory ({LSTM}) network connected behind {GAT} obtains the node neighborhood relationship, and the fully connected layer is utilized to achieve feature dimension reduction and traffic type mapping. Experiments on the {NSL}-{KDD}2009 and {CIC}-{IDS}2017 datasets show that the detection accuracy of the {GLD}-Net method for two classifications (normal and {DDoS} flow) and three classifications (normal, fast {DDoS} flow, and slow {DDoS} flow) reaches 0.993 and 0.942, respectively. Compared with the existing {DDoS} attack detection methods, its average improvement is 0.11 and 0.081, respectively. In addition, the correlation coefficient between the detection accuracy of attack flow and the four source distribution indicators ranges from 0.7 to 0.83, which lays a foundation for the inference of attack source distribution. Notably, we are the first to fuse topology and flow features and achieve high-performance {DDoS} attack intrusion detection through graph-style neural networks.

	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) over distributed multi-party data is required for a variety of domains. Existing approaches, such as federated learning, collect the outputs computed by a group of devices at a central aggregator and run iterative algorithms to train a globally shared model. Unfortunately, such approaches are susceptible to a variety of attacks, including model poisoning, which is made substantially worse in the presence of sybils. In this paper we first evaluate the vulnerability of federated learning to sybil-based poisoning attacks. We then describe {\textbackslash}emph\{{FoolsGold}\}, a novel defense to this problem that identifies poisoning sybils based on the diversity of client updates in the distributed learning process. Unlike prior work, our system does not bound the expected number of attackers, requires no auxiliary information outside of the learning process, and makes fewer assumptions about clients and their data. In our evaluation we show that {FoolsGold} exceeds the capabilities of existing state of the art approaches to countering sybil-based label-flipping and backdoor poisoning attacks. Our results hold for different distributions of client data, varying poisoning targets, and various sybil strategies. Code can be found at: https://github.com/{DistributedML}/{FoolsGold}},

	abstract = {The Internet and computer networks are exposed to an increasing number of security threats. With new types of attacks appearing continually, developing flexible and adaptive security oriented approaches is a severe challenge. In this context, anomaly-based network intrusion detection techniques are a valuable technology to protect target systems and networks against malicious activities. However, despite the variety of such methods described in the literature in recent years, security tools incorporating anomaly detection functionalities are just starting to appear, and several important problems remain to be solved. This paper begins with a review of the most well-known anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques. Then, available platforms, systems under development and research projects in the area are presented. Finally, we outline the main challenges to be dealt with for the wide scale deployment of anomaly-based intrusion detectors, with special emphasis on assessment issues. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This change diversifies the attacker’s attack vectors, increasing the impact and damage of cyber threats. Cyber threat intelligence ({CTI}) technology is a proof-based security system which responds to these advanced cyber threats proactively by analyzing and sharing security-related data. However, the performance of {CTI} systems can be significantly compromised by creating and disseminating improper security policies if an attacker intentionally injects malicious data into the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based {CTI} framework that improves confidence in the source and content of the data and can quickly detect and eliminate inaccurate data for resistance to a Sybil attack. The proposed framework collects {CTI} by a procedure validated through smart contracts and stores information about the metainformation of data in a blockchain network. The proposed system ensures the validity and reliability of {CTI} data by ensuring traceability to the data source and proposes a system model that can efficiently operate and manage {CTI} data in compliance with the de facto standard. We present the simulation results to prove the effectiveness and Sybil-resistance of the proposed framework in terms of reliability and cost to attackers.},

Furthermore, we identify and analyze fourteen attacks related to {IoT} and {IIoT} connectivity protocols, which are categorized into ﬁve threats, including, {DoS}/{DDoS} attacks, Information gathering, Man in the middle attacks, Injection attacks, and Malware attacks. In addition, we extract features obtained from different sources, including alerts, system resources, logs, network trafﬁc, and propose new 61 features with high correlations from 1176 found features. After processing and analyzing the proposed realistic cyber security dataset, we provide a primary exploratory data analysis and evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches (i.e., traditional machine learning as well as deep learning) in both centralized and federated learning modes.

In this paper, a {VFL} method for feature selection, which is an effective dimensionality reduction technique that selects a subset of informative features from high-dimensional data by eliminating irrelevant and redundant features, is proposed. Because of the potential insufficiency of useful information for learning informative features and the difficulty in sharing raw data among parties due to the increasing awareness of data privacy protection, it is desirable to exploit information from multiple parties without raw data sharing. In this paper, we propose a {VFL}-based feature selection method that leverages deep learning models as well as complementary information from features in the same samples at multiple parties without data disclosure. In order to further improve feature selection performance, information of samples that do not have features appearing in all parties are also utilized. Promising results in extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of collaborative feature selection without data sharing.},

These systems could be considered a source of privacy-aware risks. Application of the federated learning paradigm for training attack and anomaly detection models may signiﬁcantly decrease such risks as the data generated locally are not transferred to any party, and training is performed mainly locally on data sources. Another beneﬁt of the usage of federated learning for intrusion detection is its ability to support collaboration between entities that could not share their dataset for conﬁdential or other reasons. While this approach is able to overcome the aforementioned challenges it is rather new and not well-researched. The challenges and research questions appear while using it to implement analytical systems. In this paper, the authors review existing solutions for intrusion and anomaly detection based on the federated learning, and study their advantages as well as open challenges still facing them. The paper analyzes the architecture of the proposed intrusion detection systems and the approaches used to model data partition across the clients.

Different from most existing {FL} approaches requiring data from different parties share either the same feature space or sample {ID} space, federated transfer learning ({FTL}), which is a recently proposed {FL} concept, is designed for situations where data from different parties differ not only in samples but also in feature space. However, like most traditional {FL} approaches, {FTL} methods also suffer from issues caused by insufficiency of overlapping data. In this paper, we propose a novel {FTL} framework referred to as Semi-Supervised Federated Heterogeneous Transfer Learning ({SFHTL}) to leverage on the unlabeled non-overlapping samples to reduce model overfitting as a result of insufficient overlapping training samples in {FL} scenarios. Unlike existing {FTL} approaches, {SFHTL} makes use of non-overlapping samples from all parties to expand the training set for each party to improve local model performance. Through extensive experimental evaluation based on real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant advantages of {SFHTL} over state-of-the-art approaches.},

Thereby, it improves not only privacy but is also efﬁcient as it uses the computation power and data of potentially millions of clients for training in parallel. However, {FL} is vulnerable to so-called inference attacks by malicious aggregators which can infer information about clients’ data from their model updates. Secure aggregation restricts the central aggregator to only learn the summation or average of the updates of clients.

	abstract = {Vehicular Sensor Networks ({VSN}) introduced a new paradigm for modern transportation systems by improving trafﬁc management and comfort. However, the increasing adoption of smart sensing technologies with the Internet of Things ({IoT}) made {VSN} a high-value target for cybercriminals. In recent years, Machine Learning ({ML}) and Deep Learning ({DL}) techniques attracted the research community to develop security solutions for {IoT} networks. Traditional {ML} and {DL} approaches that operate with data stored on a centralized server raise major privacy problems for user data. On the other hand, the resourceconstrained nature of a smart sensing network demands lightweight security solutions. To address these issues, this article proposes a Federated Learning ({FL})-based attack detection framework for {VSN}. The proposed scheme utilizes a group of Gated Recurrent Units ({GRU}) with a Random Forest ({RF})-based ensembler unit. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is investigated through multiple performance metrics. Experimental ﬁndings indicate that the proposed {FL} approach successfully detected the cyberattacks in {VSN} with the highest accuracy of 99.52\%. The other performance scores, precision, recall, and F1 are attained as 99.77\%, 99.54\%, and 99.65\%, respectively.},

However, public datasets are limited, thus, it is promising to generate synthetic graphs with realistic properties based on real topologies for the augmentation of existing data sets. As the generation of synthetic graphs has been in the focus of researchers of various applications ﬁelds since several decades, we have a variety of traditional model-dependent and modelindependent graph generators at hand, as well as {DL}-based approaches, such as Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}). In this work, we adapt and evaluate these existing generators for the {WAN} use case, i. e., for generating synthetic {WAN} networks with realistic geographical distances between nodes. Moreover, we investigate a hierarchical graph synthesis approach, which divides the synthesis into local clusters. Finally, we compare the similarity of synthetic and real {WAN} topologies and discuss the suitability of the generators for data augmentation in the {WAN} use case.},

	title = {Blockchained Federated Learning for Threat Defense},
	abstract = {Given the increasing complexity of threats in smart cities, the changing environment and the weakness of traditional security systems, which in most cases fail to detect serious threats such as zero-day attacks, the need for alternative more active and more effective security methods keeps increasing. Such approaches are the adoption of intelligent solutions to prevent, detect and deal with threats or anomalies under the conditions and the operating parameters of the infrastructure in question. Intelligent systems are capable, of displaying logical, empirical, and non-human decision-making, since they are trained appropriately by historical data representative of the problem they are trying to solve. In most cases, it is either not possible or it is inappropriate to centrally store all smart cities data. Thus, we should perform real-time knowledge mining and we should obtain a subset of a data flow containing a small but recent percentage of observations. This fact raises serious objections to the accuracy and reliability of the employed intelligent system classifiers, who have been tame over time and they become incapable of detecting serious threats. This research paper introduces the development of an intelligent Threat Defense system, employing Blockchain Federated Learning, which seeks to fully upgrade the way passive intelligent systems operate, aiming at implementing an Advanced Adaptive Cooperative Learning ({AACL}) mechanism for smart cities networks. The {AACL} is based on the most advanced methods of computational intelligence, while ensuring privacy and anonymity for participants and stakeholders. The proposed framework combines Federated Learning for the distributed and continuously validated learning of the tracing algorithms. Learning is achieved through encrypted smart contracts within the blockchain technology, for unambiguous validation and control of the process. The aim of the proposed Framework is to intelligently classify smart cities networks traffic derived from Industrial {IoT} ({IIoT}) by Deep Content Inspection ({DCI}) methods, in order to identify anomalies that are usually due to Advanced Persistent Threat ({APT}) attacks.},

This continuous stream of data is open to attack during its collection, transportation, processing, dissemination and storage cycle. Also, {IoT} devices themselves are points of system vulnerability through which the system can be attacked. Machine learning ({ML}), due to its ability to identify inherent patterns and behaviour in data, has been applied by many researchers to {IoT} data such that strange patterns or intrusions into {IoT} systems can be speedily detected and real-time decisions on security and privacy (S\&P) protection implemented in a timely manner. Different {ML} techniques with their different algorithms have provided solutions in various scenarios such that security and privacy requirements for the {IoT} system can be met. In particular, {ML} has been successfully applied in intrusion detection and has been shown to perform better than traditional means in flagging new trends of attacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review on {ML} intrusion detection in {IoT}. Academic journals from 2011 to 2021 from two databases ({IEEE} and {ProQuest}) were explored using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and {MetaAnalyses} ({PRISMA}) framework. A review of the final selected papers revealed that data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training and deployment of {ML}-based Intrusion Detection Systems ({IDS}) increase computational complexity resulting in greater resource requirement ({CPU}, memory, and energy); enable {ML} to be used in the execution of adversarial attacks on {IoT} devices and networks (as seen with emerging attacks); give rise to scalability issues especially due to the heterogeneous nature of {IoT} networks; require trade-offs between detection accuracy and false-positive events; and highlight the superior performance of deep learning methods over traditional {ML} ones in anomaly detection. Generally, the changing nature of attacks makes it difficult for any particular {IDS} to be able to detect all attack types thus making the development of {IDS} a continuing project.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIT.2020.3035868},
	abstract = {We study distributed optimization in the presence of Byzantine adversaries, where both data and computation are distributed among m worker machines, t of which may be corrupt. The compromised nodes may collaboratively and arbitrarily deviate from their pre-specified programs, and a designated (master) node iteratively computes the model/parameter vector for generalized linear models. In this work, we primarily focus on two iterative algorithms: Proximal Gradient Descent ({PGD}) and Coordinate Descent ({CD}). Gradient descent ({GD}) is a special case of these algorithms. {PGD} is typically used in the data-parallel setting, where data is partitioned across different samples, whereas, {CD} is used in the model-parallelism setting, where data is partitioned across the parameter space. At the core of our solutions to both these algorithms is a method for Byzantine-resilient matrix-vector ({MV}) multiplication; and for that, we propose a method based on data encoding and error correction over real numbers to combat adversarial attacks. We can tolerate up to t≤ m-12rfloor corrupt worker nodes, which is information-theoretically optimal. We give deterministic guarantees, and our method does not assume any probability distribution on the data. We develop a sparse encoding scheme which enables computationally efficient data encoding and decoding. We demonstrate a trade-off between the corruption threshold and the resource requirements (storage, computational, and communication complexity). As an example, for t≤q m 3 , our scheme incurs only a constant overhead on these resources, over that required by the plain distributed {PGD}/{CD} algorithms which provide no adversarial protection. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that connects {MV} multiplication with {CD} and designs a specific encoding matrix for {MV} multiplication whose structure we can leverage to make {CD} secure against adversarial attacks. Our encoding scheme extends efficiently to (i) the data streaming model, in which data samples come in an online fashion and are encoded as they arrive, and (ii) making stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}) Byzantine-resilient. In the end, we give experimental results to show the efficacy of our proposed schemes.},

	abstract = {Cooperative cyberdefense has been recognized as an essential strategy to fight against cyberattacks. Cybersecurity Information Sharing ({CIS}), especially about threats and incidents, is a key aspect in this regard. {CIS} provides members with an improved situational awareness to prepare for and respond to future cyberthreats. Privacy preservation is critical in this context, since organizations can be reluctant to share information otherwise. This is particularly critical when {CIS} is facilitated through an untrusted infrastructure provided by a third party (e.g., the cloud). Despite this, current data formats and protocols for {CIS} do not guarantee any form of privacy preservation to participants. In this paper we introduce {PRACIS}, a scheme for {CIS} networks that guarantees private data forwarding and aggregation. {PRACIS} leverages the well-known Structured Threat Information Expression ({STIX}) standard data format. Remarkably, {PRACIS} can be seamlessly integrated with existing {STIX}-based message brokering middleware such as publish-subscribe architectures. {PRACIS} achieves these goals by combining standard format-preserving and homomorphic encryption primitives. We discuss experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation developed for a subset of {STIX}. Results show that entities may create up to 689 incidents per minute, far beyond the estimated average of 81. Moreover, aggregation of 104 incidents can be carried out in just 2.1 s, and the transmission overhead is just 13.5 kbps. Overall, these results suggest that the costs incurred by {PRACIS} are easily affordable in real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {Background: To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets.
Results: The Matthews correlation coefficient ({MCC}), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset.
Conclusions: In this article, we show how {MCC} produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of {MCC} in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

Through a revisiting of the key tenets of the triad, the paper reconciles these two, seemingly fragmented, approaches. The main argument is that the {CIA} triad will continue to assume a major role in information security practice.

	abstract = {Knowledge transfer is critical in making use of data from multi-source domains, but most existing techniques are not privacy-preserving. Nowadays, data leakage, together with the advancement of big-data-driven Artificial Intelligence, has raised huge concerns over data security. The neglect of privacy makes such approaches impractical. For addressing intrusion detection tasks, the Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model ({DAGMM}) concatenates and jointly optimizes a compression and an estimation network in an unsupervised manner. However, {DAGMM} still suffers from the lack of diversely distributed intrusion samples in real-life scenarios where organizations are neither willing nor legally allowed to engage in data sharing. Given the increasing public concern over data privacy and scandals, federated learning which only allows model parameter sharing is thus proposed to enhance model performance while preserving data privacy. Moreover, it also addresses the competitive concerns on the part of organizations when sharing data with their rivals. This study proposes a Federated Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (F-{DAGMM}) to build up privacy-preserving knowledge transfer, to further support inter-organizational cooperation and high-level decision making. A two-phase federated optimization strategy is proposed to address the performance degradation caused by the significant differences in the individual clients’ data distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed F-{DAGMM}.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication ({ISAC}) is a novel paradigm using crowdsensing spectrum sensors to help with the management of spectrum scarcity. However, well-known vulnerabilities of resource-constrained spectrum sensors and the possibility of being manipulated by users with physical access complicate their protection against spectrum sensing data falsiﬁcation ({SSDF}) attacks. Most recent literature suggests using behavioral ﬁngerprinting and Machine/Deep Learning ({ML}/{DL}) for improving similar cybersecurity issues. Nevertheless, the applicability of these techniques in resource-constrained devices, the impact of attacks affecting spectrum data integrity, and the performance and scalability of models suitable for heterogeneous sensors types are still open challenges. To improve limitations, this work presents seven {SSDF} attacks affecting spectrum sensors and introduces {CyberSpec}, an {ML}/{DL}-oriented framework using device behavioral ﬁngerprinting to detect anomalies produced by {SSDF} attacks affecting resource-constrained spectrum sensors. {CyberSpec} has been implemented and validated in {ElectroSense}, a real crowdsensing {RF} monitoring platform where several conﬁgurations of the proposed {SSDF} attacks have been executed in different sensors. A pool of experiments with different unsupervised {ML}/{DL}-based models has demonstrated the suitability of {CyberSpec} detecting the previous attacks within an acceptable timeframe.},

These attacks have serious consequences, not only for cyber-security, but also for safety, as the cyber and physical worlds are increasingly linked. Providing effective cyber-security requires cooperation and collaboration among all the entities involved. Increasing the amount of cyber threat information ({CTI}) available for analysis allows better prediction, prevention and mitigation of cyber-attacks. However, organizations are deterred from sharing their {CTI} over concerns that sensitive and confidential information may be revealed to others. We address this concern by providing a flexible framework that allows the confidential sharing of {CTI} for analysis between collaborators. We propose a five-level trust model for a cloud-edge based data sharing infrastructure. The data owner can choose an appropriate trust level and {CTI} data sanitization approach, ranging from plain text, through anonymization/pseudonymization to homomorphic encryption, in order to manipulate the {CTI} data prior to sharing it for analysis. Furthermore, this sanitization can be performed by either an edge device or by the cloud service provider, depending upon the level of trust the organization has in the latter. We describe our trust model, our cloud-edge infrastructure, and its deployment model, which are designed to satisfy the broadest range of requirements for confidential {CTI} data sharing. Finally we briefly describe our implementation and the testing that has been carried out so far by four pilot projects that are validating our infrastructure.},

Security of {IoT} has become a critical concern. The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of {IoT} but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved bothways, in terms of complexity and diversity. Hence, to identify and prevent or detect novel attacks, it is important to analyze techniques in {IoT} context. This survey classifies the {IoT} security threats and challenges for {IoT} networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems ({NIDSs}); hence, this paper reviews existing {NIDS} implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art {NIDS} proposals in the {IoT} context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning ({ML}) {NIDS} techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on {IoT} {NIDS} deployed via {ML} since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of {NIDSs} deploying different aspects of learning techniques for {IoT}, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems. We believe that, this paper will be useful for academia and industry research, first, to identify {IoT} threats and challenges, second, to implement their own {NIDS} and finally to propose new smart techniques in {IoT} context considering {IoT} limitations.

	abstract = {Nowadays, the designing of cyber-physical systems has a significant role and plays a substantial part in developing a sustainable computing ecosystem for secure and scalable network architecture. The introduction of Cyber Threat Intelligence ({CTI}) has emerged as a new security system to mitigate existing cyber terrorism for advanced applications. {CTI} demands a lot of requirements at every step. In particular, data collection is a critical source of information for analysis and sharing; it is highly dependent on the reliability of the data. Although many feeds provide information on threats recently, it is essential to collect reliable data, as the data may be of unknown origin and provide information on unverified threats. Additionally, effective resource management needs to be put in place due to the large volume and diversity of the data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based cyber threat intelligence system architecture for sustainable computing in order to address issues such as reliability, privacy, scalability, and sustainability. The proposed system model can cooperate with multiple feeds that collect {CTI} data, create a reliable dataset, reduce network load, and measure organizations’ contributions to motivate participation. To assess the proposed model’s effectiveness, we perform the experimental analysis, taking into account various measures, including reliability, privacy, scalability, and sustainability. Experimental results of evaluation using the {IP} of 10 open source intelligence ({OSINT}) {CTI} feeds show that the proposed model saves about 15\% of storage space compared to total network resources in a limited test environment.},

	abstract = {The application of Machine Learning ({ML}) techniques to the well-known intrusion detection systems ({IDS}) is key to cope with increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks through an eﬀective and eﬃcient detection process. In the context of the Internet of Things ({IoT}), most {ML}-enabled {IDS} approaches use centralized approaches where {IoT} devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning ({FL}) has attracted a signiﬁcant interest in diﬀerent sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of {FL}-enabled {IDS} for {IoT} is in its infancy, and still requires research eﬀorts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a {FL}-enabled {IDS} approach based on a multiclass classiﬁer considering diﬀerent data distributions for the detection of diﬀerent attacks in an {IoT} scenario. In particular, we use three diﬀerent settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent {ToN} {IoT} dataset according to {IoT} devices’ {IP} address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of diﬀerent aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent {IBMFL} framework as {FL} implementation.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of network technology, a variety of new malicious attacks appear while attack methods are constantly updated. As the attackers exploit the vulnerabilities of popular thirdparty components to invade target websites, further improving the classification accuracy of malicious network traffic is the key to improving the performance of abnormal traffic detection. Existing intrusion detection systems may suffer from incomplete feature extraction and low classification accuracy. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient hybrid parallel deep learning model ({HPM}) for intrusion detection based on margin learning. First, {HPM} constructs two parallel {CNN} architectures and fuses the spatial features obtained through full convolution. Secondly, the temporal information of the fused features is parsed separately using two parallel {LSTMs}. Finally, the extracted spatial-temporal features are fed into the {CosMargin} classifier for classification detection after global convolution and global pooling. Besides, this paper proposes an improved traffic feature extraction method, which not only reduces redundant features but also speeds up the convergence speed of the network. In the experiment, our {HPM} has achieved 99\% detection accuracy of each malicious class, ranging from 5\%–10\% improvement with other models, which demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model.},

As Internet of Battlefield Things ({IoBT}) networks become common place in tactical environments, there is a need for improved and distributed models trained without these enterprise resources. Transfer learning – which allows us to take information learned in one domain and apply it to another – provides one way to create and distribute these models towards the edge. Using neural networks, we demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning for intrusion detection using only raw network traffic in computationally limited environments. Our results show that with a transferred one-dimensional convolutional neural network model combined with a retrained random forest model, we obtain over 96\% accuracy with only 5,000 training samples on edge devices with an edge training time of approximately 67 s.},

An inadequate description of a claim can make it difficult to reason about the claim, for example, to determine whether the claim is sound.

We believe that this situation is exacerbated, and even encouraged, by the lack of a systematic approach to exploring, exposing, and addressing the source of unsound claims and poor exposition.
            This article proposes a framework that identifies three sins of reasoning that lead to unsound claims and two sins of exposition that lead to poorly described claims and evaluations. Sins of exposition obfuscate the objective of determining whether or not a claim is sound, while sins of reasoning lead directly to unsound claims.
            Our framework provides practitioners with a principled way of critiquing the integrity of their own work and the work of others.

Hence, organizations are not only vulnerable to conventional {IT} threats, but also to a multitude of new, {IIoT}-specific attacks. Yet, a literature-based and empirically evaluated understanding of attacks on the {IIoT} is still lacking. Against this backdrop, we develop a multi-layer taxonomy that helps researchers and practitioners to identify similarities and differences between attacks on the {IIoT}. Based on the latest literature and a sample of about 50 attacks, we deductively and inductively determine attack characteristics and dimensions. We demonstrate the usefulness and practical relevance of our taxonomy by applying it to a real-world incident affecting a German steel facility. By combining {IT} security, {IIoT}, and risk management to form an interdisciplinary approach, we contribute to the descriptive knowledge in these fields. Industry experts confirm that our taxonomy enables a detailed classification of attacks, which supports the identification, documentation, and communication of incidents within organizations and their value-creation networks. With this, our taxonomy provides a profound basis for the further development of {IT} security management and the derivation of mitigation measures.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning ({FL}) has been foundational in improving the performance of a wide range of applications since it was first introduced by Google. Some of the most prominent and commonly used {FL}-powered applications are Android’s Gboard for predictive text and Google Assistant. {FL} can be defined as a setting that makes on-device, collaborative Machine Learning possible. A wide range of literature has studied {FL} technical considerations, frameworks, and limitations with several works presenting a survey of the prominent literature on {FL}. However, prior surveys have focused on technical considerations and challenges of {FL}, and there has been a limitation in more recent work that presents a comprehensive overview of the status and future trends of {FL} in applications and markets. In this survey, we introduce the basic fundamentals of {FL}, describing its underlying technologies, architectures, system challenges, and privacy-preserving methods. More importantly, the contribution of this work is in scoping a wide variety of {FL} current applications and future trends in technology and markets today. We present a classification and clustering of literature progress in {FL} in application to technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, Natural Language Processing, autonomous vehicles, and resource allocation, as well as in application to market use cases in domains of Data Science, healthcare, education, and industry. We discuss future open directions and challenges in {FL} within recommendation engines, autonomous vehicles, {IoT}, battery management, privacy, fairness, personalization, and the role of {FL} for governments and public sectors. By presenting a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of {FL}, this work serves as a reference point for researchers and practitioners to explore {FL} applications under a wide range of domains.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 lets the industry build compact, precise, and connected assets and also has made modern industrial assets a massive source of data that can be used in process optimization, defining product quality, and predictive maintenance ({PM}). Large amounts of data are collected from machines, processed, and analyzed by different machine learning ({ML}) algorithms to achieve effective {PM}. These machines, assumed as edge devices, transmit their data readings to the cloud for processing and modeling. Transmitting massive amounts of data between edge and cloud is costly, increases latency, and causes privacy concerns. To address this issue, efforts have been made to use edge computing in {PM} applications., reducing data transmission costs and increasing processing speed. Federated learning ({FL}) has been proposed a mechanism that provides the ability to create a model from distributed data in edge, fog, and cloud layers without violating privacy and offers new opportunities for a collaborative approach to {PM} applications. However, {FL} has challenges in confronting with asset management in the industry, especially in the {PM} applications, which need to be considered in order to be fully compatible with these applications. This study describes distributed {ML} for {PM} applications and proposes two federated algorithms: Federated support vector machine ({FedSVM}) with memory for anomaly detection and federated long-short term memory ({FedLSTM}) for remaining useful life ({RUL}) estimation that enables factories at the fog level to maximize their {PM} models’ accuracy without compromising their privacy. A global model at the cloud level has also been generated based on these algorithms. We have evaluated the approach using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation ({CMAPSS}) dataset to predict engines’ {RUL} Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of {FedSVM} and {FedLSTM} in terms of model accuracy, model convergence time, and network usage resources.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been considerable growth in the internet of things ({IoT})-based healthcare applications; however, they suffer from a lack of intrusion detection systems ({IDS}). Leveraging recent technologies, such as machine learning ({ML}), edge computing, and blockchain, can provide suitable and strong security solutions for preserving the privacy of medical data. In this paper, {FIDChain} {IDS} is proposed using lightweight artiﬁcial neural networks ({ANN}) in a federated learning ({FL}) way to ensure healthcare data privacy preservation with the advances of blockchain technology that provides a distributed ledger for aggregating the local weights and then broadcasting the updated global weights after averaging, which prevents poisoning attacks and provides full transparency and immutability over the distributed system with negligible overhead. Applying the detection model at the edge protects the cloud if an attack happens, as it blocks the data from its gateway with smaller detection time and lesser computing and processing capacity as {FL} deals with smaller sets of data. The {ANN} and {eXtreme} Gradient Boosting ({XGBoost}) models were evaluated using the {BoT}-{IoT} dataset. The results show that {ANN} models have higher accuracy and better performance with the heterogeneity of data in {IoT} devices, such as intensive care unit ({ICU}) in healthcare systems. Testing the {FIDChain} with different datasets ({CSE}-{CIC}-{IDS}2018, Bot Net {IoT}, and {KDD} Cup 99) reveals that the {BoT}-{IoT} dataset has the most stable and accurate results for testing {IoT} applications, such as those used in healthcare systems.},

	abstract = {With the increasing development of 5G/Beyond 5G and network softwarization techniques, we have more ﬂexibility and agility in the network. This can be exploited by Machine Learning ({ML}) to integrate intelligence in the network and improve network as well as service management in edge-cloud environment. Intrusion detection systems ({IDS}) is one of the challenging issues for managing network. However, traditional approaches in this domain require all data (and their associated labels) to be centralized at the same location. In this context, such approaches lead to: (i) a large bandwidth overhead, as raw data needs to be transmitted to the server, (ii) low incentives for devices to send their private data, and (iii) large computing and storage resources needed on the server side to label and treat all this data. In this paper, to cope with the above limitations, we propose a semi-supervised federated learning model for {IDS}. Moreover, we use network softwarisation for automation and deployment. Our model combines Federated Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning where the clients train unsupervised models (using unlabeled data) to learn the representative and low-dimensional features and the server conducts a supervised model (using labeled data). We evaluate this approach on the well-known {UNSW}-{NB}15 dataset and the experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve accuracy and detection rates up to 84.32\% and 83.10\%, respectively while keeping the data private with limited overhead.},

Our proposal leverages the integration of ensemble learning to realistic network environments, by combining layers of detectors devoted to monitor the behavior of the applications employed by the organization. Our proposal is validated through extensive experiments performed in heterogeneous network settings simulating botnet detection scenarios, and consider detectors based on distinct machine- and deep-learning algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of {AppCon} in mitigating the dangerous threat of adversarial attacks in over 75\% of the considered evasion attempts, while not being affected by the limitations of existing countermeasures, such as performance degradation in non-adversarial settings. For these reasons, our proposal represents a valuable contribution to the development of more secure cyber defense platforms.},

	abstract = {Security has become a critical issue for Industry 4.0 due to different emerging cyber-security threats. Recently, many Deep Learning ({DL}) approaches have focused on intrusion detection. However, such approaches often require sending data to a central entity. This in turn raises concerns related to privacy, efficiency, and latency. Despite the huge amount of data generated by the Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices in Industry 4.0, it is difficult to get labeled data, because data labeling is costly and time-consuming. This poses many challenges for several {DL} approaches, which require labeled data. In order to deal with these issues, new approaches should be adopted. This paper proposes a novel federated semi-supervised learning scheme, that takes advantage of both unlabeled and labeled data in a federated way. First, an {AutoEncoder} ({AE}) is trained on each device (using unlabeled local/private data) to learn the representative and low-dimensional features. Then, a cloud server aggregates these models into a global {AE} using Federated Learning ({FL}). Finally, the cloud server composes a supervised neural network, by adding fully connected layers ({FCN}) to the global encoder (the first part of the global {AE}) and trains the resulting model using publicly available labeled data. Extensive case studies on two real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that our model: (a) ensures that no local private data is exchanged; (b) detects attacks with high classification performance, (c) works even when only a few amounts of labeled data are available; (d) has low communication overhead.},

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks ({WSN}) have become increasingly one of the hottest research areas in computer science due to their wide range of applications including critical military and civilian applications. Such applications have created various security threats, especially in unattended environments. To ensure the security and dependability of {WSN} services, an Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) should be in place. This {IDS} has to be compatible with the characteristics of {WSNs} and capable of detecting the largest possible number of security threats. In this paper a specialized dataset for {WSN} is developed to help better detect and classify four types of Denial of Service ({DoS}) attacks: Blackhole, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling attacks. This paper considers the use of {LEACH} protocol which is one of the most popular hierarchical routing protocols in {WSNs}. A scheme has been defined to collect data from Network Simulator 2 ({NS}-2) and then processed to produce 23 features. The collected dataset is called {WSN}-{DS}. Artificial Neural Network ({ANN}) has been trained on the dataset to detect and classify different {DoS} attacks. The results show that {WSN}-{DS} improved the ability of {IDS} to achieve higher classification accuracy rate. {WEKA} toolbox was used with holdout and 10-Fold Cross Validation methods. The best results were achieved with 10-Fold Cross Validation with one hidden layer. The classification accuracies of attacks were 92.8\%, 99.4\%, 92.2\%, 75.6\%, and 99.8\% for Blackhole, Flooding, Scheduling, and Grayhole attacks, in addition to the normal case (without attacks), respectively.},

Instead of using a centralised server for training, the model uses data stored locally on the device itself. After that, the server uses this model to create a jointly trained model. Federated learning asserts that privacy is preserved because no data is sent. Botnet attacks are detected using on-device decentralised traffic statistics and a deep autoencoder. This proposed federated learning approach addresses privacy and security concerns about data privacy and security rather than allowing data to be transferred or relocated off the network edge. In order to get the intended results of a previously centralised machine learning technique while also increasing data security, computation will be shifted to the edge layer. Up to 98\% accuracy is achieved in anomaly detection with our proposed model using features like {MAC} {IP} and source/destination/{IP} for training.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06974},
	abstract = {Internet of things ({IoT}) devices are prone to attacks due to the limitation of their privacy and security components. These attacks vary from exploiting backdoors to disrupting the communication network of the devices. Intrusion Detection Systems ({IDS}) play an essential role in ensuring information privacy and security of {IoT} devices against these attacks. Recently, deep learning-based {IDS} techniques are becoming more prominent due to their high classiﬁcation accuracy. However, conventional deep learning techniques jeopardize user privacy due to the transfer of user data to a centralized server. Federated learning ({FL}) is a popular privacy-preserving decentralized learning method. {FL} enables training models locally at the edge devices and transferring local models to a centralized server instead of transferring sensitive data. Nevertheless, {FL} can suffer from reverse engineering {ML} attacks that can learn information about the user’s data from model. To overcome the problem of reverse engineering, mimic learning is another way to preserve the privacy of {ML}-based {IDS}. In mimic learning, a student model is trained with the public dataset, which is labeled with the teacher model that is trained by sensitive user data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of {FL} and mimic learning, namely federated mimic learning to create a distributed {IDS} while minimizing the risk of jeopardizing users’ privacy, and benchmark its performance compared to other {ML}-based {IDS} techniques using {NSL}-{KDD} dataset. Our results show that we can achieve 98.11\% detection accuracy with federated mimic learning.},

With the connectivity of sensors, actuators, appliances, and other industrial objects, {IIoT} enables data availability, improved analytics, and automatic control. Thanks to the complex distributed nature, a wide range of stealthy and evolving cyberattacks become a major threat to the trustworthiness and security of {IIoT} systems. This makes the standard security procedures unable to assure the trustworthiness of {IIoT} that protect against cyberattacks. As a remedy, this work presents a Blockchain Orchestrated Edge Intelligence ({BoEI}) framework that integrates an innovative decentralized federated learning (called Fed-Trust) for cyberattack detection in {IIoT}. In the Fed-Trust, a Temporal convolutional generative network ({TCGAN}) is introduced to enable semi-supervised learning from semi-labeled data. {BoEI} includes reputation-based Blockchain to enable decentralized recording and verification of the transactions for guaranteeing the security and privacy of data and gradients. fog computing is exploited to offload the block mining operation from the edge side thereby improving the overall computation and communication performance of Fed-Trust. Proof of concept simulations using two public datasets validate the robustness and efficiency of the Fed-Trust over the cutting-edge Cyberattack detection approaches.},

One of the major challenges is the lack of labeled training data. In this paper, we use federated learning to tackle data scarcity problem and to preserve data privacy, where multiple participants collaboratively train a global model. Unlike the centralized training architecture, participants do not need to share their training to the server in federated learning, which can prevent the training data from being exploited by attackers. Moreover, most of the previous works focus on one specific task of anomaly detection, which restricts the application areas and can not provide more valuable information to network administrators. Therefore, we propose a multi-task deep neural network in federated learning ({MT}-{DNN}-{FL}) to perform network anomaly detection task, {VPN} (Tor) traffic recognition task, and traffic classification task, simultaneously. Compared with multiple single-task models, the multi-task method can reduce training time overhead. Experiments conducted on well-known {CICIDS}2017, {ISCXVPN}2016, and {ISCXTor}2016 datasets, show that the detection and classification performance achieved by the proposed method is better than the baseline methods in centralized training architecture.},

However, the data owned by different clients, even with the same label, may induce conflicts in the latent feature maps, especially under the non-{IID} {FL} scenarios. This would fatally impair the performance of the global model. To this end, we propose a novel approach, {DAFL}, for Dual Adversarial Federated Learning, to mitigate the divergence on latent feature maps among different clients on non-{IID} data. In particular, a local dual adversarial training is designed to identify the origins of latent feature maps, and then transforms the conflicting latent feature maps to reach a consensus between global and local models in each client. Besides, the latent feature maps of the two models become closer to each other adaptively by reducing their Kullback Leibler divergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of {DAFL} and also demonstrate that {DAFL} outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of test accuracy under different non-{IID} settings.},

	abstract = {Because of the many types of Internet of Things ({IoT}) attacks, as well as the lack of computing resources for some devices, the small number of anomalous datasets and the lack of updated data, resulting in insufficient training data and computational power for supervised learning-based intrusion detection models and the Internet datasets still dominate the research on {IoT} intrusion detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a {VGG}-{RED} approach to {IoT} intrusion detection based on Transfer Learning ({TL}), which migrates the feature weights from the training of two Internet intrusion detection datasets to the training of three {IoT} intrusion detection datasets respectively, and inter-migrates the three {IoT} datasets. The classification models are trained by model parameter migration and neural network fine-tuning. Unlike previous work on extracting manually designed features, this method retains the end-to-end learning performance of Deep Learning ({DL}), reduces the risk of concept migration occurring, and reduces human intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the {VGG}-{RED} model to migrate Internet attack classification to the {IoT}. The model can effectively improve the accuracy of malicious attack detection in {IoT} environments while reducing computational resources, and has a strong generalization capability, with an accuracy improvement of about 2\% and a time reduction of 7-13\%.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}), as a promising distributed learning paradigm, has put many efforts into distributed intrusion detection systems ({IDS}), for defending against various malicious attacks, such as {SQL} injection and {DDoS} attacks. Compared with traditional {IDS} based on centralized deep learning ({DL}), {FL}-based solutions require not to share users’ raw data while yielding better detection performance. However, state-ofthe-art {FL}-based methods still suffer from two key limitations: 1) insufﬁcient detection performance on non-independent and identically distributed (non-{IID}) data, and 2) high communication and computational overheads due to the utilization of large-scale neural network models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight collaborative intrusion detection framework, called {CoLGBM}, the ﬁrst of its kind in the regime of decentralized {IDS}, where decision tree and light gradient boosting machine ({LGBM}) are combined for constructing the detection scheme. The main insight is that through combining user-trained decision trees (each user’s decision tree is derived from its own data with unique distribution), our framework can perform effectively on non-{IID} data while working efﬁciently for handling enormous samples. Compared with the current {FL}-based methods, our {CoLGBM} achieves higher accuracy and lower overhead on both {IID} and non-{IID} data. Extensive experiment results demonstrate our scheme with high-level performance.},

Considering these drawbacks, we have brought an unsupervised deep learning approach that uses autoencoders to learn from unlabeled data. Our approach uses federated machine learning and can be trained across the unlabeled dataset of edge devices without compromising people’s privacy.

Considering the degradation of the model performance due to the statistic heterogeneity of the training data, we devise a runtime distribution reconstruction strategy, which reallocates the clients appropriately and utilizes mediators to rearrange the local training of the clients. In addition, we design a compression-correction mechanism incorporated into H-{FL} to reduce the communication overhead while not sacriﬁcing the model performance. To further provide privacy guarantees, we introduce differential privacy while performing local training, which injects moderate amount of noise into only part of the complete model.

The server evaluates the accuracy of the uploaded local model with a benchmark dataset, and then updates model parameters according to the accuracy ratio. Experimental results show the model accuracy of our proposed method performs better than existing methods.

	title = {How transferable are features in deep neural networks?},
	abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the ﬁrst layer they learn features similar to Gabor ﬁlters and color blobs. Such ﬁrst-layer features appear not to be speciﬁc to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to speciﬁc by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus speciﬁcity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difﬁculties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on {ImageNet}, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A ﬁnal surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after ﬁne-tuning to the target dataset.},

Besides, we implement a two-step feature selection scheme to avoid overfitting and reduce computation time. Through extensive experiments on the {NSL}-{KDD} dataset, we demonstrate that {FeCo} achieves as high as 8\% accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art and is robust to non-{IID} data.

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) has been shown vulnerable to a new class of adversarial attacks, known as model poisoning attacks ({MPA}), where one or more malicious clients try to poison the global model by sending carefully crafted local model updates to the central parameter server. Existing defenses that have been fixated on analyzing model parameters show limited effectiveness in detecting such carefully crafted poisonous models. In this work, we propose {FLARE}, a robust model aggregation mechanism for {FL}, which is resilient against state-of-the-art {MPAs}. Instead of solely depending on model parameters, {FLARE} leverages the penultimate layer representations ({PLRs}) of the model for characterizing the adversarial influence on each local model update. {PLRs} demonstrate a better capability to differentiate malicious models from benign ones than model parameter-based solutions. We further propose a trust evaluation method that estimates a trust score for each model update based on pairwise {PLR} discrepancies among all model updates. Under the assumption that honest clients make up the majority, {FLARE} assigns a trust score to each model update in a way that those far from the benign cluster are assigned low scores. {FLARE} then aggregates the model updates weighted by their trust scores and finally updates the global model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of {FLARE} in defending {FL} against various {MPAs}, including semantic backdoor attacks, trojan backdoor attacks, and untargeted attacks, and safeguarding the accuracy of {FL}.},

While existing works mainly focus on reducing the total bits transferred in each update via data compression, we study an orthogonal approach that identiﬁes irrelevant updates made by clients and precludes them from being uploaded for reduced network footprint. Following this idea, we propose Communication-Mitigated Federated Learning ({CMFL}) in this paper. {CMFL} provides clients with the feedback information regarding the global tendency of model updating. Each client checks if its update aligns with this global tendency and is relevant enough to model improvement. By avoiding uploading those irrelevant updates to the server, {CMFL} can substantially reduce the communication overhead while still guaranteeing the learning convergence. {CMFL} is shown to achieve general improvement in communication efﬁciency for almost all of the existing federated learning schemes. We evaluate {CMFL} through extensive simulations and {EC}2 emulations. Compared with vanilla Federated Learning, {CMFL} yields 13.97x communication efﬁciency in terms of the reduction of network footprint. When applied to Federated Multi-Task Learning, {CMFL} improves the communication efﬁciency by 5.7x with 4\% higher prediction accuracy.},

This paper presents the Malware Information Sharing Plat- form ({MISP}) and threat sharing project, a trusted platform, that allows the collection and sharing of important indica- tors of compromise ({IoC}) of targeted attacks, but also threat information like vulnerabilities or financial indicators used in fraud cases. The aim of {MISP} is to help in setting up preven- tive actions and counter-measures used against targeted at- tacks.

However, privacy is one of the major concerns of organizations, while they are gathering security information to share externally. In order to preserve the privacy of organizations in the cybersecurity information sharing framework, we propose a novel mechanism which consists of four components: (i) Registration, (ii) Sharing, (iii) Dispute, (iv) Rewarding. Our mechanism enables the organizations to share their cybersecurity information without revealing their identities. Besides, in order to encourage collaboration and prevent free-riding, rewards are issued anonymously in return for contributions. For this purpose, we are proposing a new aggregatable blind signature based on {BBS}+ signature scheme. Security analysis and performance evaluation are conducted showing the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.},

Based on the analysis of sensor data, unexpected or malicious behavior is detected. Those schemes often rely on (implicit) assumptions on temporally stable sensor data distributions and invariants between process values. Unfortunately, the proposed schemes often perform not optimally with Recall scores lower than 70\% (e.g., missing 3 alarms every 10 anomalies) for some {ICS} datasets, with unclear root issues. In this work, we propose a general framework to check whether a given {ICS} dataset has specific properties (stable sensor distributions in normal operations, potentially state-dependent), which then allows to determine whether certain Anomaly Detection approaches can be expected to perform well. We apply our framework to three datasets showing that the behavior of actuators and sensors are very different between Training set and Test set. In addition, we present high-level guides to consider when designing an Anomaly Detection System.},

We argue that testbeds for artifact generation have to be designed specifically with reproducibility and adaptability in mind. To achieve this goal, we present {SOCBED}, our proof-of-concept implementation and the first testbed with a focus on generating realistic log data for cybersecurity experiments in a reproducible and adaptable manner. {SOCBED} enables researchers to reproduce testbed instances on commodity computers, adapt them according to own requirements, and verify their correct functionality.

The reporting propagates from child to parent nodes until it reaches the root. A novel control message, distress propagation object ({DPO}), is devised to report the anomaly to the subsequent parents and ultimately the edge-router. The {DPO} message is integrated to routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks ({RPL}). The system has configurable profile settings and it is able to learn and differentiate the nodes' normal and suspicious activities without a need for prior knowledge. It has different subsystems and operation phases at data link and network layers, which share a common repository in a node. The system uses network fingerprinting to be aware of changes in network topology and nodes' positions without any assistance from a positioning system.},

However, previous works in this area do not consider access control for {CYBEX}. In this work, we tackle the access control problem in {CYBEX}. We model the attribute based access control in {CYBEX} with a semi-trusted sharing server. To achieve attribute based access control in {CYBEX}, our mechanism is developed based on the concepts of ciphertext policy attribute based encryption ({CP}-{ABE}) [1] and {STIX} [2]. The mechanism's workflow is as follows, at the beginning users claim their attributes from attribute authorities, then a key generation center generates decryption keys for users based on their attributes. For the sharing, organizations embed access control to their shared data. This is conducted by encrypting sensitive information such that only users with appropriate attributes can decrypt them. Security analysis, implementation and performance evaluation indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the mechanism.},

However, stimulating organizations to participate and deterring free-riding in such sharing is a big challenge. To this end, the sharing system should be equipped with a rewarding and participation-fee allocation mechanisms to encourage sharing behavior. In this paper, we investigate a rewarding and participation-fee calculation based on profit sharing in coalitional game theory. In particular, we formulate a coalitional game between organizations and analyze the well-known Shapley value and Nucleolus solution concepts in cybersecurity information sharing system.},

Besides, patterns of recent cyberattacks tend to be changeable, which add up to unpredictability of them. On the other hand, machine learning, as a new method used to detect intrusion, is attracting more and more attention. Moreover, through the sharing of local training data, the centralized learning approach has proven to improve a model’s performance. In this research, a segmented federated learning is proposed, different from a collaborative learning based on single global model in a traditional federated learning model, it keeps multiple global models which allow each segment of participants to conduct collaborative learning separately and rearranges the segmentation of participants dynamically as well. Furthermore, these multiple global models interact with each other for updating parameters, thus being adaptable to various participants’ {LANs}. A dataset covering two months’ traffic data from 20 participants’ {LANs} in the {LAN}-Security Monitoring Project is used. We adopt three types of knowledgebased methods for labeling network events and train a {CNN} model based on the dataset. At last, we achieve validation accuracies of 0.923, 0.813 and 0.877 individually with these labeling methods.},

We ﬁnd the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium probabilities and corresponding Bayesian belief updates. We simulate the game to ﬁnd the best response strategies with which regular and malicious organizations can play to increase their payoffs. Based on the best response strategies of organizations, we analyze that achieving more anomaly detection rate while keeping the processing rate minimum is the best action strategy with which {CYBEX} can play to increase the gain of both {CYBEX} and regular organizations over malicious organizations.

Algorithms for detecting intrusions are under rapid development, but far from being mature. One interesting and difficult issue is how to study and test a new intrusion detection algorithm against a variety of (perhaps simulated) intrusive activities under realistic background traffic. A flexible and general-purpose platform for testing intrusion detection algorithms is clearly desirable. This paper presents such a software platform, called {IntruDetector}. With this platform, detection algorithms can be tested directly in a real environment with wide range of intrusive activities. The data of normal system activities are directly collected from the live environment, and are mixed with intrusive activities that are simulated by hybrid simulation. The main properties of this approach are: (1) the background traffic is realistic; (2) it allows flexible simulation of various types of intrusions; and (3) normal system operation will not be disrupted by virtually simulated destructive intrusions during testing.},

Operators of such environments may not even be fully aware of their {IoT} assets, let alone whether each {IoT} device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This paper proposes the use of network traffic analytics to characterize {IoT} devices, including their typical behaviour mode. We first collect and synthesize traffic traces from a smart-campus environment instrumented with a diversity of {IoT} devices including cameras, lights, appliances, and health-monitors; our traces, collected over a period of 3 weeks, are released as open data to the public. We then analyze the traffic traces to characterize statistical attributes such as data rates and burstiness, activity cycles, and signalling patterns, for over 20 {IoT} devices deployed in our environment. Finally, using these attributes, we develop a classification method that can not only distinguish {IoT} from non-{IoT} traffic, but also identify specific {IoT} devices with over 95\% accuracy. Our study empowers operators of smart cities and campuses to discover and monitor their {IoT} assets based on their network behaviour.},

However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection. © 2010 {IEEE}.},

At the core of {MAS} is a heterogeneous entity graph comprised of six types of entities that model the scholarly activities: ﬁeld of study, author, institution, paper, venue, and event. In addition to obtaining these entities from the publisher feeds as in the previous effort, we in this version include data mining results from the Web index and an in-house knowledge base from Bing, a major commercial search engine. As a result of the Bing integration, the new {MAS} graph sees signiﬁcant increase in size, with fresh information streaming in automatically following their discoveries by the search engine. In addition, the rich entity relations included in the knowledge base provide additional signals to disambiguate and enrich the entities within and beyond the academic domain. The number of papers indexed by {MAS}, for instance, has grown from low tens of millions to 83 million while maintaining an above 95\% accuracy based on test data sets derived from academic activities at Microsoft Research. Based on the data set, we demonstrate two scenarios in this work: a knowledge driven, highly interactive dialog that seamlessly combines reactive search and proactive suggestion experience, and a proactive heterogeneous entity recommendation.},

The open exchange of information and knowledge regarding threats, vulnerabilities, incidents and mitigation strategies results from the organizations' growing need to protect against today's sophisticated cyber attacks. To investigate data quality challenges that might arise in threat intelligence sharing, we conducted focus group discussions with ten expert stakeholders from security operations centers of various globally operating organizations. The study addresses several factors affecting shared threat intelligence data quality at multiple levels, including collecting, processing, sharing and storing data. As expected, the study finds that the main factors that affect shared threat intelligence data stem from the limitations and complexities associated with integrating and consolidating shared threat intelligence from different sources while ensuring the data's usefulness for an inhomogeneous group of participants.Data quality is extremely important for shared threat intelligence. As our study has shown, there are no fundamentally new data quality issues in threat intelligence sharing. However, as threat intelligence sharing is an emerging domain and a large number of threat intelligence sharing tools are currently being rushed to market, several data quality issues - particularly related to scalability and data source integration - deserve particular attention.},

Hence, intrusion detection systems must also evolve to meet these increasingly challenging threats. Machine learning is often used to support this needed improvement. However, training a good prediction model can require a large set of labeled training data. Such datasets are difﬁcult to obtain because privacy concerns prevent the majority of intrusion detection agencies from sharing their sensitive data. In this paper, we propose the use of mimic learning to enable the transfer of intrusion detection knowledge through a teacher model trained on private data to a student model. This student model provides a mean of publicly sharing knowledge extracted from private data without sharing the data itself. Our results conﬁrm that the proposed scheme can produce a student intrusion detection model that mimics the teacher model without requiring access to the original dataset.},

	abstract = {Medical Cyber-Physical Systems ({MCPS}) are networked systems of medical devices that provide seamless integration of physical and computation components in healthcare environments to deliver high quality care by enabling continuous monitoring and treatment. As {MCPS} store sensitive medical data and personal health data, security breaches and unauthorized access to this information can lead to severe repercussions for both the patient and hospital in the form of loss of privacy, abuse, physical harm and liability. The heterogeneity of devices involved in these systems (such as body sensor nodes and mobile devices) introduce large attack surfaces and hence necessitate the design of effective security solutions for these environments. In this paper, we design and implement a massively distributed, machine-learning-based intrusion detection solution for {MCPS}. Speciﬁcally, we explore the concept of Federated Learning to minimize the communication and computation costs involved in traditional machine learning based solutions. We evaluate our design with real patient data and against security attacks such as Denial of Service, data modiﬁcation, and data injection. Experimental results illustrate that our system achieves high detection accuracy of 99.0\% and a False Positive Rate of 1.0\% along with a reduced network communication overhead. Lastly, we show that the system can cope with unevenly distributed data and is a scalable solution that leverages the computing resources of many mobile devices.},

Such a maintenance approach is based on a detailed analysis that takes into account the technical and contextual characteristics of the target industrial equipment. However, this analysis requires a significant period of time to collect a representative quantity of data to learn a predictive model. Federated learning ({FL} in short) is a promising approach that allows several participants to build collaboratively a global predictive model. This approach has been widely explored in generic {loT} applications and large scale architectures. However, the implementation of {FL} in actual environments requires to consider several issues to adapt to existing {loT} architectures, including the management/orchestration of the federated tasks and handling the limitations of computational resources. Indeed, most of the current research focus on the aggregation of heavy deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose an architecture for {FL} in the context of {loT} based on the classical 3-layer architecture standardized by {ETSI} 11https://www.etsi.org/. We consider new features for performing federated tasks (training, aggregation and man-agement of each participant). We also propose a stacking-based aggregation method to build the global model in a cost-efficient way. We evaluate finally the performance and effectiveness of this approach on real use-case scenarios. The comparison with other models trained in a centralized way highlights the benefit of our approach.},

With the remarkable progress of {MCPS} technologies in recent years, there is a need to advance the security measures to efﬁciently detect attacks in this domain. Research on intrusion detection for medical cyber physical systems is still in its infancy. For an efﬁcient intrusion detection system ({IDS}), it is important to address the problem of feature selection to remove redundant, irrelevant and noisy features. Feature selection is even more relevant to address in {MCPS} as the use of entire feature space places unnecessary burden on resource constrained systems in this domain. Also since realtime detection of attacks is critical in healthcare systems, the amount of data processed by {IDS} must be reduced to achieve low detection latency. In this paper, we investigate the problem of feature selection in medical cyber physical systems. Our initial results demonstrate the laplacian scoring techniques are successful in optimal feature selection with reduced memory consumption.},

Existing frameworks focus on a single fieldbus protocol or require more detailed knowledge of the cyber-physical system itself. Thus, we introduce a uniform method and framework for applying anomaly detection to a variety of fieldbus protocols. We use stacked denoising autoencoders to derive a feature learning and packet classification method in one step. As the approach is based on the raw byte stream of the network traffic, neither specific protocols nor detailed knowledge of the application is needed. Additionally, we pay attention on creating an efficient framework which can also handle the increased amount of communication in cyber-physical systems. Our evaluation on a Secure Water Treatment dataset using {EtherNet}/{IP} and a Modbus dataset shows that we can acquire network packets up to 100 times faster than packet parsing based methods. However, we still achieve precision and recall metrics for longer lasting attacks of over 99\%.},

The most interesting category (which we call functionality extension attacks) uses the designed functionality of the {IoT} device to achieve a totally different effect. To demonstrate this type of attack, we consider the case of smart lights (whose original functionality is just to control the color and intensity of the lights in a particular room) and show how to use them to achieve unrelated effects. In the first attack, we use smart lights as a covert {LIFI} communication system to exfiltrate data from a highly secure (or even fully airgapped) office building. We implemented the attack and were able to read the leaked data from a distance of over 100 meters using only cheap and readily available equipment. In another attack, we showed that an attacker can strobe the lights at a frequency which may trigger seizures in people suffering from photosensitive epilepsy (in the same way that rapidly flashing video games can cause such seizures). In our experiments, we have tested both high-end and lower-end smart light systems, ranging from an expensive Philips {HUE} system to a cheap system manufactured by {LimitlessLED}. In addition, we consider other weaknesses of the systems we tested, and propose feasible remedies for the problems we found.},

Federated Learning ({FL}) has been proposed as a new distributed machine learning approach, which collaboratively trains a prediction model by aggregating local models of users without sharing their privacy-sensitive data. Recently, the approach is applied to optimize intrusion detection for resourced-constrained environments. However, since the attacks are becoming more sophisticated and targeted, there is also a growing need to enhance detection models according to the characteristics of attack type; meanwhile, choosing effective feature sets from the network trafﬁc characteristics is considered one of the most important technologies in data analysis. In this paper, we ﬁrst proposed a federated learning-based intrusion detection system with feature selection technology. Firstly, a greedy algorithm is suggested to select features that achieve better intrusion detection accuracy regarding different attack categories. Afterward, multiple global models are generated by the server in federated learning, according to the decided features of edge devices. For evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation experiments based on the latest on-device neural network for anomaly detection are conducted over the {NSL}-{KDD} dataset. Experimental results demonstrate greatly improved accuracy of our method.},

Alerts generated in the occurrence of detected anomalies can be used as a complementary source of information for decision making and action by the Security Operations Center ({SOC}) team to deal with an eventual security incident.

	doi = {10.1109/ICDCECE53908.2022.9793016},
	abstract = {Intrusion detection has proven to be an efficient strategy of information security since it can identify unknown attacks from network traffic. The existing method to detect network anomalies is often based on classic machine learning models like {KNN}, {SVM}, and others. Even though these techniques can provide some impressive results, they have a poor level of accuracy and rely primarily on manual system design is required in feature extraction which is no longer relevant in the big data era. A deep learning-based intrusion detection methodology is suggested in this method to address the issues of low accuracy and feature extraction. The recurrent neural network is used in this approach with three steps in preprocessing such as data numerical conversion, data normalization, and data balancing. It can efficiently represent network traffic flow and enhance the capacity to identify anomalies. The suggested model is put to the test using a publicly available benchmark dataset, and the findings show that it outperforms alternative comparison approaches. The result analysis of the proposed method shows that the average accuracy is 99.56\%, average {TPR} is 99.55\%, average {TNR} is 99.32\%.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a {FEderated} cyber-Attack Reaction ({FEAR}) system using Deep Q-Network algorithm for distributed software-defined networks. In our recent study [1], we propose a Q-learning based cyber-attack reaction control system, called {CARS}, for a single {SDN}. However, for real network deployments that are usually distributed over the Internet, the {CARS} suffers from two main shortcomings, i.e., a slow-convergence rate of Q-learning algorithm and the scalability issue. Therefore, in this paper, we first develop a Deep Q-Network ({DQN}) based cyber-attack reaction control algorithm to assist the control agent in obtaining the optimal policy quickly. Next, we propose a federated {DQN} based cyber-attack reaction control system, which eliminates the scalability problem and improves the learning performance of the {DQN} algorithm in a distributed manner. As our case study on denial-of-service ({DoS}) attacks, the obtained results show that the {FEAR} can effectively protect the victim from malicious packets, i.e., approximately 90\% of attack packets are discarded. Furthermore, by deploying the optimal cyber-attack reaction policy, the {FEAR} can reduce the ratio of {QoS} (Quality-of-Service) violated traffic flows compared to the {CARS} (by approx. 44\%) and the {GATE} (by approx. 63\%).},

	abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things ({IoMT}) is a set of medical devices and applications that connect to healthcare systems through the Internet. Those devices are equipped with communication technologies that allow them to communicate with each other and the Internet. Reliance on the {IoMT} is increasing with the increase in epidemics and chronic diseases such as {COVID}-19 and diabetes; with the increase in the number of {IoMT} users and the need for electronic data sharing and virtual services, cyberattacks in the healthcare sector for accessing conﬁdential patient data has been increasing in the recent years. The healthcare applications and their infrastructures have special requirements for handling sensitive users’ data and the need for high availability. Therefore, securing healthcare applications and data has attracted special attention from both industry and researchers. In this paper, we propose a Federated Transfer Learning-based Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) to secure the patient’s healthcare-connected devices. The model uses Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) algorithm for training the network and transferring the knowledge from the connected edge models to build an aggregated global model and customizing it for each one of the connected edge devices without exposing data privacy. {CICIDS}2017 dataset has been used to evaluate the performance in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and average training time. In addition to preserving data privacy of edge devices and achieving better performance, our comparison indicates that the proposed model can be generalized better and learns incrementally compared to other baseline {ML}/{DL} algorithms used in the traditional centralized learning schemes.},

	abstract = {In {IoT} healthcare environment, the devices are not sufficiently powerful for operating recent deep learning models, and data collected by the devices are usually decentralized. Moreover, data are unavailable to share between devices because of information security issues. Therefore, a concept of federated learning has emerged to overcome data sharing issues, and a concept of binarized neural network has emerged to generate lightweight deep learning models. This paper proposes a federated binarized neural network model to derive a reliable healthcare system in this circumstance. This paper shows an overview of considered system model with constrained {IoT} healthcare devices. In addition, this paper shows illustrations of implementing the proposed federated learning model with the proposed binarized {MLP} networks by utilizing an open-source library. The experiment results show that the binarized {MLP} network shows comparable performances compared to the fullprecision {MLP} network while the binarized {MLP} requires about 10-times less model size for training.},

	abstract = {{IoT} devices are increasingly deployed in daily life. Many of these devices are, however, vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. As a result, many networks already have vulnerable {IoT} devices that are easy to compromise. This has led to a new category of malware specifically targeting {IoT} devices. However, existing intrusion detection techniques are not effective in detecting compromised {IoT} devices given the massive scale of the problem in terms of the number of different types of devices and manufacturers involved. In this paper, we present {DÏoT}, an autonomous self-learning distributed system for detecting compromised {IoT} devices. {DÏoT} builds effectively on device-type-specific communication profiles without human intervention nor labeled data that are subsequently used to detect anomalous deviations in devices' communication behavior, potentially caused by malicious adversaries. {DÏoT} utilizes a federated learning approach for aggregating behavior profiles efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a federated learning approach to anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection. Consequently, {DÏoT} can cope with emerging new and unknown attacks. We systematically and extensively evaluated more than 30 off-the-shelf {IoT} devices over a long term and show that {DÏoT} is highly effective (95.6\% detection rate) and fast (257 ms) at detecting devices compromised by, for instance, the infamous Mirai malware. {DÏoT} reported no false alarms when evaluated in a real-world smart home deployment setting.},

Nevertheless, identifying an ongoing attack in a heterogeneous network is a non-trivial task. Federated learning emerges as a solution to collaborative training for an Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}). The federated learning-based {IDS} trains a global model using local machine learning models provided by federated participants without sharing local data. However, optimization challenges are intrinsic to federated learning. This paper proposes the Federated Simulated Annealing ({FedSA}) metaheuristic to select the hyperparameters and a subset of participants for each aggregation round in federated learning. {FedSA} optimizes hyperparameters linked to the global model convergence. The proposal reduces aggregation rounds and speeds up convergence. Thus, {FedSA} accelerates learning extraction from local models, requiring fewer {IDS} updates. The proposal assessment shows that the {FedSA} global model converges in less than ten communication rounds. The proposal requires up to 50\% fewer aggregation rounds to achieve approximately 97\% accuracy in attack detection than the conventional aggregation approach.},

	abstract = {Existing cyber security solutions have been basically developed using knowledge-based models that often cannot trigger new cyber-attack families. With the boom of Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), especially Deep Learning ({DL}) algorithms, those security solutions have been plugged-in with {AI} models to discover, trace, mitigate or respond to incidents of new security events. The algorithms demand a large number of heterogeneous data sources to train and validate new security systems. This paper presents the description of new datasets, the so-called {ToN}\_IoT, which involve federated data sources collected from Telemetry datasets of {IoT} services, Operating system datasets of Windows and Linux, and datasets of Network traffic. The paper introduces the testbed and description of {TON}\_IoT datasets for Windows operating systems. The testbed was implemented in three layers: edge, fog and cloud. The edge layer involves {IoT} and network devices, the fog layer contains virtual machines and gateways, and the cloud layer involves cloud services, such as data analytics, linked to the other two layers. These layers were dynamically managed using the platforms of software-Defined Network ({SDN}) and Network-Function Virtualization ({NFV}) using the {VMware} {NSX} and {vCloud} {NFV} platform. The Windows datasets were collected from audit traces of memories, processors, networks, processes and hard disks. The datasets would be used to evaluate various {AI}-based cyber security solutions, including intrusion detection, threat intelligence and hunting, privacy preservation and digital forensics. This is because the datasets have a wide range of recent normal and attack features and observations, as well as authentic ground truth events. The datasets can be publicly accessed from this link [1].},

Thanks to advancements in machine learning algorithms and big data, the automation of mundane tasks with artificial intelligence is becoming a reliable smart option. However, existing approaches based on centralized Machine Learning ({ML}) on sensor cloud networks fail to ensure data privacy. Moreover, centralized {ML} works with the pre-requisite to transfer the entire training dataset from end devices to a central server. To address this, we propose a Quantized Federated Learning ({FL}) based approach, called {CloudFL}, to ensure data privacy on end devices in a sensor cloud network. Our framework enables a personalized version of {FL} implementation and enhances privacy and security with cryptosystem tools to obfuscate the information of the {FL} process from unauthorized access. Furthermore, microservices of our approach provide software as a service implementation of {FL} with instances of cloud servers that require zero-touch on local data for training.},

	abstract = {Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-{IID} data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems are commonly used by organizations to monitor network trafﬁc and detect attacks or suspicious behaviours. However, many attacks occur across organizations and are often difﬁcult to detect using any single {IDS}. Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems could lead to more accurate prediction and detection of cyber threats as well as a reduction of security administrators’ workload as similar threats from different places can be merged. However, most organizations are unwilling to disclose sensitive information about their internal network topology and trafﬁc, lending these systems unusable. Existing solutions using homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation are often expensive. In this paper, we propose efﬁcient and privacy preserving techniques to correlate alerts generated at different organizations. We propose {skP} rototypes, a distributed clustering algorithm for horizontally partitioned mixed data using additive secret sharing. This algorithm can be used to create a privacy preserving, collaborative intrusion detection system. We also propose {dpkP} rototypes which uses differential privacy on categorical attributes and is more efﬁcient than {skP} rototypes for categorical attributes with many distinct values. Theoretical and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.},

	doi = {10.1109/DSN-W54100.2022.00016},
	abstract = {Federated learning is a framework for machine learning that is dedicated to data privacy protection. In federated learning, system cannot fully control the behavior of clients which can be faulty. These behaviors include sharing arbitrary faulty gradients and delaying the process of sharing due to Byzantine attacks or clients’ own software and hardware failures. In federated learning, the parameter server may also be faulty during gradient collection and aggregation, mainly including gradient-based training data inference and model parameter faulty update. The above problems may lead to reduced accuracy of federated learning model training, leakage of client privacy, etc. Existing research enhances the robustness of federated learning by exploiting the decentralization and immutability of Blockchain. For untrusted clients, most research is based on Byzantine fault tolerance to defend against clients indiscriminately, and may cause model accuracy reduction. In addition, most of the research focus on unencrypted gradients, and there is insufficient research on dealing with client anomalies in the case of gradient encryption. For untrusted parameter servers, existing research has problems in energy overhead and scalability. Aiming at the problems above, this paper studies the robustness of federated learning, and proposes a blockchain-based federated learning parameter update architecture {PUS}-{FL}. Through experiments simulating distributed machine learning on neural networks, we demonstrate that the anomaly detection algorithm of {PUS}-{FL} outperforms conventional gradient filters including geometric median, Multi-Krum and trimmed mean. In addition, our experiments also verify that the scalability-enhanced parameter aggregation consensus algorithm proposed in this paper({SE}-{PBFT}) improves consensus scalability by reducing communication complexity.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables a large number of devices to collaboratively learn a model without sharing their raw data. Despite its practical efﬁciency and effectiveness, the iterative on-device learning process incurs a considerable cost in terms of learning time and energy consumption, which depends crucially on the number of selected clients and the number of local iterations in each training round. In this paper, we analyze how to design adaptive {FL} that optimally chooses these essential control variables to minimize the total cost while ensuring convergence. Theoretically, we analytically establish the relationship between the total cost and the control variables with the convergence upper bound. To efﬁciently solve the cost minimization problem, we develop a low-cost sampling-based algorithm to learn the convergence related unknown parameters. We derive important solution properties that effectively identify the design principles for different metric preferences. Practically, we evaluate our theoretical results both in a simulated environment and on a hardware prototype. Experimental evidence veriﬁes our derived properties and demonstrates that our proposed solution achieves near-optimal performance for various datasets, different machine learning models, and heterogeneous system settings.},

	abstract = {Cloud federation is the evolution of modern cloud computing. It provides better resource-sharing, perfect resource-utilization, and load-balancing. However, the heterogeneity of security policies and configurations between cloud service providers makes it hard for users to totally trust them. Further, the severe impact of modern cloud attacks such as cross-side channels on federated environments is a major roadblock against such evolution. Securing users' capsules (Virtual Machines and containers) against cross-side channel attacks is considered as a big challenge to cloud service providers. Moving-target Defense ({MtD}) by live capsule migration was introduced as an effective mechanism to overcome such challenge. However, researchers noted that even with {MtD}, migrated capsules can still be tracked via routing information. In this paper, we propose a novel Blockchain-based routing mechanism to enable trace-resistant Moving-target Defence ({BMtD}) to enable anonymous live cross-cloud migrations of running capsules in federated cloud environments. Exploiting the Vulnerable, Exposed, Attacked, Recovered ({VEAR}) model, simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of {BMtD} in minimizing viral attack dispersion.},

The errors destabilize the results and challenge the findings of numerous publications that have relied on it as a benchmark. We demonstrate the implications of these errors through several experiments. We provide comprehensive documentation to summarize the discovery of these issues, as well as a fully-recreated dataset, with labeling logic that has been reverse-engineered, corrected, and made publicly available for the first time. We demonstrate the implications of dataset errors through a series of experiments. The findings serve to remind the research community of common pitfalls with dataset creation processes, and of the need to be vigilant when adopting new datasets. Lastly, we strongly recommend the release of labeling logic for any dataset released, to ensure full transparency.},

However, research has shown that the adversary can still reconstruct the users’ private information even if little information is leaked. To address this problem, several approaches of privacy-preserving distributed training have been exploited with existing mature technologies, such as Differential Privacy, Secure Multi-party Computation and Homomorphic Encryption. However, stateof-the-art results are still defective in security, functionality and efﬁciency. In this paper, we propose an Efﬁcient {PrivacyPreserving} Scheme ({EPPS}) for distributed deep learning.

Speciﬁcally, we adopt the threshold Paillier encryption as the underlying structure to construct our secure training model. Hence, the conﬁdentiality of honest users’ of local gradients can be guaranteed, even the cloud server colluding with multiple users. In addition, since users are often accidentally ofﬂine due to either network environment or equipment damage, our {EPPS} can also support users exiting at any phases of the entire work process. Further more, we conducted extensive experiments on real-world data to demonstrate the preferable performance of our proposed scheme.

Another difficulty lies in the correct capture of the network packets. If it is not the case, the characteristics of the network flows generated from the capture could be modified and lead to false results. In this paper, we present several flaws we identified in the labelling of the {CICIDS}2017 dataset and in the traffic capture, such as packet misorder, packet duplication and attack that were performed but not correctly labelled.

	abstract = {The edge computing paradigm has been adopted in many Internet-of-Things ({IoT}) applications to improve responsiveness and conserve communication resources. However, such high agility and efficiency come with increased cyber threats. Intrusion detection systems ({IDS}) have been the primary means for guarding networked computing assets against hacking attempts. The popular design methodology for {IDS} relies on the application of machine learning ({ML}) techniques that use intelligence data to classify malicious activities. However, in the realm of {IoT}, insufficient data is available to build {IDS}; hence a distributed intrusion system with continual data collection is primordial to refine the detection model. Such {IDS} is also subject to privacy constraints and should sustain robustness against data manipulation from internal attackers that degrade the {ML} model. This paper opts to fulfill these requirements by proposing a novel distributed {IDS} for {IoT}. The proposed system employs federated learning to enable privacy preservation and diminish the communication overhead. Our system promotes a reinforcement mechanism to ensure resiliency to data manipulation attacks by single or colluding internal actors.

	abstract = {Data provenance tracks the origin of information with the goal of improving trust among interested parties. Data provenance is an important requirement for a range of applications such as food safety, supply chains, and tracking of epidemic outbreaks. Many of these applications are inherently distributed and require high levels of privacy and trust.Fog computing and Blockchains are recent technological solutions that were born from advancements in cloud and distributed computing. Fog focuses on bringing the cloud closer to the edge user while Blockchain provides transparency without the need for a trusted centralized entity. Both can be complimentary as Fog spreads the data and computer storage while the Blockchain can keep it consistent and trustworthy. These technologies can be used to improve several aspects in a Data provenance context.In this paper we describe an architecture that allows the tracking of data provenance in a wide-area distributed fog. While we employ blockchains to provide transparency, localized Fogs have control over what is made public on the cloud. The architecture proposed in this paper enables fast and reliable data provenance for clients executing in the Fog using software services that keep the information consistent across all interested parties in the cloud. Any information in the system is associated with a proof of authenticity, but authors have control over the eventual publication of the information.Our proposal was built upon the well established provenance model W3C Prov, which simplifies adoption of the framework.We developed an application consisting of a client and web services that is able to store and share provenance information using open standards in a blockchain. The relate work, architecture and tests for the proposal are presented showing performance improvements when Fog is used when compared to a solution that only runs in the cloud.},

We studied how accurately we can automatically classify requirements as functional ({FR}) and non-functional ({NFR}) in the dataset with supervised machine learning. Furthermore, we assessed how accurately we can identify various types of {NFRs}, in particular usability, security, operational, and performance requirements. We developed and evaluated a supervised machine learning approach employing meta-data, lexical, and syntactical features. We employed under-and over-sampling strategies to handle the imbalanced classes in the dataset and cross-validated the classifiers using precision, recall, and F1 metrics in a series of experiments based on the Support Vector Machine classifier algorithm. We achieve a precision and recall up to 92\% for automatically identifying {FRs} and {NFRs}. For the identification of specific {NFRs}, we achieve the highest precision and recall for security and performance {NFRs} with 92\% precision and 90\% recall.

	abstract = {Cyber intrusion attacks that compromise the users' critical and sensitive data are escalating in volume and intensity, especially with the growing connections between our daily life and the Internet. The large volume and high complexity of such intrusion attacks have impeded the effectiveness of most traditional defence techniques. While at the same time, the remarkable performance of the machine learning methods, especially deep learning, in computer vision, had garnered research interests from the cyber security community to further enhance and automate intrusion detections. However, the expensive data labeling and limitation of anomalous data make it challenging to train an intrusion detector in a fully supervised manner. Therefore, intrusion detection based on unsupervised anomaly detection is an important feature too. In this paper, we propose a three-stage deep learning anomaly detection based network intrusion attack detection framework. The framework comprises an integration of unsupervised (K-means clustering), semi-supervised ({GANomaly}) and supervised learning ({CNN}) algorithms. We then evaluated and showed the performance of our implemented framework on three benchmark datasets: {NSL}-{KDD}, {CIC}-{IDS}2018, and {TON} {IoT}.},

	abstract = {The Internet-of-Things ({IoT}) has quickly evolved to a new appified era where third-party developers can write apps for {IoT} platforms using programming frameworks. Like other appified platforms, e.g., the smartphone platform, the permission system plays an important role in platform security. However, design flaws in current {IoT} platform permission models have been reported recently, exposing users to significant harm such as break-ins and theft. To solve these problems, a new access control model is needed for both current and future {IoT} platforms. In this paper, we propose {ContexIoT}, a context-based permission system for appified {IoT} platforms that provides contextual integrity by supporting fine-grained context identification for sensitive actions, and runtime prompts with rich context information to help users perform effective access control. Context definition in {ContexIoT} is at the inter-procedure control and data flow levels, that we show to be more comprehensive than previous context-based permission systems for the smartphone platform. {ContexIoT} is designed to be backward compatible and thus can be directly adopted by current {IoT} platforms. We prototype {ContexIoT} on the Samsung {SmartThings} platform, with an automatic app patching mechanism developed to support unmodified commodity {SmartThings} apps. To evaluate the system’s effectiveness, we perform the first extensive study of possible attacks on appified {IoT} platforms by reproducing reported {IoT} attacks and constructing new {IoT} attacks based on smartphone malware classes. We categorize these attacks based on lifecycle and adversary techniques, and build the first taxonomized {IoT} attack app dataset. Evaluating {ContexIoT} on this dataset, we find that it can effectively distinguish the attack context for all the tested apps. The performance evaluation on 283 commodity {IoT} apps shows that the app patching adds nearly negligible delay to the event triggering latency, and the permission request frequency is far below the threshold that is considered to risk user habituation or annoyance.},

Software-Defined Networking ({SDN}) technology has been shown to provide various benefits to support the {IoV}. However, the construction of {IoV} makes it a complex system posing several challenges among which the important ones are security and privacy of data. Intrusion Detection Systems ({IDSs}) have been proposed in the {IoV} to identify cyber attacks and protect private data. Recently work has started to implement {IDSs} based on Federated learning as collaborative {IDSs} have proved effective security of {IoV}. In another hand, trust management has revolutionized the {IoV} filed, providing decision-making support to secure the network. Stating that an {SDN}-driven {IoV} architecture in which nodes trustworthiness gets assessed can provide a promising framework for {IDS}, we propose in this paper a Federated learning-based {IDS} for the {IoV} under the {SDN} structure. We integrate trust metrics to assist in securing the {IoV} network. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the proposal.},

	abstract = {As a network security defense technology, intrusion detection system can effectively protect network security. At present, machine learning is widely used in intrusion detection and has achieved good application results. The detection methods based on traditional machine learning need enough available intrusion detection data samples, and the samples meet the conditions of independent and identically distributed. However, in reality, the intrusion detection data generated by a single institution is insufficient, and various institutions protect users' privacy and data security in the form of islands, which makes it difficult to maintain the same data distribution. In addition, there is the problem of data imbalance. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new intrusion detection method {FTLCNN}, which integrates federal transfer learning and convolutional neural network. {FTLCNN} constructs a transfer convolution neural network framework to solve the problems of sample scarcity, imbalance and probability adaptation; under the mechanism of federal learning, {FTLCNN} use the model to learn without sharing training data, protect data privacy and solve the problem of data island. The experimental on {UNSW}-{NB}15 shows that compared with the other four benchmark algorithms, {FTLCNN} has higher detection rate and lower false positive rate, and has significant advantages in solving the problem of scarcity and imbalance of in intrusion detection.},

For the case of malicious behavior, we designed sessions for two types of insider threats (masqueraders and traitors). The game involved the participation of 6 teams consisting of 4 students who competed with each other for a period of 5 days, while their activities were monitored considering several heterogeneous sources (mouse, keyboard, process and file-system monitor, network traffic, emails and login/logout). In sum, we obtained 320 hours of active participation that included 18 hours of masquerader data and at least two instances of traitor data. Additionally to malicious behaviors, the students explored various defensive and offensive strategies, such as denial of service attacks and obfuscation techniques, in an effort to get ahead in the competition.

To rectify the mentioned issues, a scalable deep federated learning-based method is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, each client trains an unsupervised deep neural network model using local data and shares its parameters with a server. The server aggregates the clients’ parameters, makes a generalized public model, and shares it with all clients. The proposed model is evaluated using a real-world {ICS} dataset in a water treatment system and compared with two non-federated learning-based methods.

	abstract = {Communities, and the critical infrastructure that they rely upon, are becoming ever increasingly integrated into cyberspace. At the same time, communities are experiencing increasing activity and sophistication from a variety of threat agents. The effect of cyber attacks on communities has been observed, and the frequency and devastation of these attacks can only increase in the foreseeable future. Early detection of these attacks is critical for a fast and effective response. We propose detecting community cyber incidents by comparing indicators from community members across space and time. Performing spatiotemporal differentiation on these indicators requires that community members, such as private and governmental organizations, share information about these indicators. However, community members are, for good reasons, reluctant to share sensitive security related information. Additionally, sharing large amounts of information with a trusted, centralized location introduces scalability and reliability problems. In this paper we define the information sharing requirements necessary for fast, effective community cyber incident detection and response, while addressing both privacy and scalability concerns. Furthermore, we introduce a framework to meet these requirements, and analyze a proof of concept implementation. © 2012 {IEEE}.},

With this enhanced ubiquity and sensitivity, concerns about ethics, trust, transparency, and accountability inevitably arise. Given the threat of sophisticated cyberattacks, it’s critical to establish cybersecurity trustworthy concepts and to develop methodologies and concepts for a wide range of explainable machine cybersecurity models that will assure reliable threat identification and detection, more research is needed. This survey examines a variety of explainable machine learning techniques that can be used to implement a reliable cybersecurity infrastructure in the cybersecurity domain. The main aim of this study is to execute an in-depth review and identification of existing explainable machine learning algorithms for cyberattack detection. This study employed the seven-step survey model to determine the research domain, implement search queries, and compile all retrieved articles from digital databases. This research looks at the literature on trustworthy machine learning algorithms for detecting cyberattacks. An extensive search of electronic databases such as {ArXiv}, Semantic Scholar, {IEEE} Xplore, Wiley Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, {ACM}, and Springer was carried out to find relevant literature in the subject domain. From 2016 to 2022, this study looked at white papers, conference papers, and journals. Only 25 research papers were chosen for this research paper describing trustworthy cybersecurity and explainable {AI} cybersecurity after we retrieved 800 articles from web databases. The study reveals that the decision tree technique outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning models in terms of transparency and interpretability. Finally, this research suggests that incorporating explainable into machine learning cybersecurity models will help uncover the root causes of defensive failures, making it easier for cybersecurity experts to enhance both cybersecurity infrastructures and development, rather than just model results, policy, and management.},

The standardization of {NWDAF} by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) would enable third-party data analytics service providers to develop and provide {AI}-driven data analytics services to the Mobile Network Operators. The next-generation Radio Access Networks would require advanced analytics to drive closed-loop self-organizing network functions that are targeted to cognitively enhance network ef ciency and reduce the operational and capital costs of network operators. The existing solutions in this domain rely on conventional {ML} approaches that require the training data to be accumulated on a single data center. The concerns in this area would be the network overload and the privacy of the network operators that are sharing huge volumes of sensitive network data to the third-party Network Data Analytics Services ({NDAS}) executing over edge cloud infrastructures, perhaps even operated by some other players. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a Federated Learning based approach to train {ML} models for cognitive network management of future mobile networks that can enable network operators to get data analytics services by collaboratively building a shared learning model while retaining their critical data locally within their trusted domains.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to apply Shiryaev’s quickest change detection ({QCD}) technique in the {FL} realm. {QCD} is applied to detect abnormal changes in statistical properties of model parameters in {FL} as quickly as possible. We apply {QCD} on the server-side in two ways. First, {QCD} is applied to detect a change in the statistical properties over the model parameters sent by the participating devices. Second, {QCD} is applied to the history of aggregated {FL} model parameters. The ﬁrst approach facilitates identifying malicious clients which can be eliminated in future learning activities. The other approach assists the server to roll back to an earlier version of the model in case of identifying the anomaly in the aggregated {FL} parameters. As {QCD} is applied on the server-side, it does not add any computation overhead on the client-side as well as communication overheard during transmission. These two approaches are evaluated with the help of numerical results.},

Current security approaches are inaccurate, expensive, or unscalable, as they require static signatures of known attacks, specialized hardware, or full packet inspection. The {IETF} Manufacturer Usage Description ({MUD}) framework aims to reduce the attack surface on an {IoT} device by formally defining its expected network behavior. In this paper, we use {SDN} to monitor compliance with the {MUD} behavioral profile, and develop machine learning methods to detect volumetric attacks such as {DoS}, reflective {TCP}/{UDP}/{ICMP} flooding, and {ARP} spoofing to {IoT} devices. Our first contribution develops a machine for detecting anomalous patterns of {MUD}-compliant network activity via coarse-grained (device-level) and fine-grained (flow-level) {SDN} telemetry for each {IoT} device, thereby giving visibility into flows that contribute to a volumetric attack. For our second contribution we measure network behavior of {IoT} devices by collecting benign and volumetric attacks traffic traces in our lab, label our dataset, and make it available to the public. Our last contribution prototypes a full working system (built with an {OpenFlow} switch, Faucet {SDN} controller, and a {MUD} policy engine), demonstrates its application in detecting volumetric attacks on several consumer {IoT} devices with high accuracy, and provides insights into cost and performance of our system. Our data and solution modules are released as open source to the community.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is considered to be a promising paradigm to solve data privacy disclosure in large-scale machine learning. To further enhance the privacy protection of federated learning, prior works incorporate the differentially private data perturbation into the federated system. But it is not feasible given the impairment of the model from noise, as adding Gaussian noise to achieve differential privacy ({DP}) deteriorates the accuracy of the model. In particular, the assumption that the sophisticated system is homogeneous is not realistic for real scenarios. Heterogeneous networks exacerbate noise disruptions. In this paper, we present {FedSeC}, a novel differential private federated learning ({DP}-{FL}) framework which operates with robust convergence and high-accuracy while achieving adequate privacy protection. {FedSeC} improves upon naive combinations of federated learning and differential privacy approaches with an updates-based optimization of relative-staleness and semi-synchronous approach for fast convergence in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, we propose a valid client selection scheme to trade-off fair resource allocation and discriminatory incentives. Through extensive experimental validation of our method in three different heterogeneities, we show that {FedSeC} outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method.},

We consider the susceptibility of federated learning to sybil attacks and propose a taxonomy of sybil objectives and strategies in this setting. We describe a new {DoS} attack that we term training inflation and present several ways to carry out this attack. We then evaluate recent distributed {ML} fault tolerance proposals and show that these are insufficient to mitigate several sybil-based attacks. Finally, we introduce a defense against targeted sybil-based poisoning called {FoolsGold}, which identifies sybils based on the diversity of client updates.

	abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies are increasingly intertwined across the economies and societies of developed countries. Protecting these technologies from cyberthreats requires collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships. The fact that Communication and Information Systems ({CIS}) security1 is an international issue increases the complexity of these relationships. Cyber defense collaboration presents specific challenges since most entities would like to share cyber-related data but lack a successful model to do so. We will explore four aspects of cyber defense collaboration to identify approaches for improving cyber defense information sharing. First, incentives and barriers for information sharing, which includes the type of information that may be of interest to share and the motivations that cause social networks to be used or stagnate. Second, collaborative risk management and information value perception. This includes risk management approaches that have built-in mechanisms for sharing and receiving information, increasing transparency, and improving entity peering relationships. Third, we explore procedural models for improving data exchange, with a focus on inter-governmental collaborative challenges. Fourth, we explore automation of sharing mechanisms for commonly shared cyber defense data (e.g., vulnerabilities, threat actors, black/ white lists). In order to reach a common understanding of terminology in this paper, we leverage the {NATO} {CIS} Security Capability Breakdown [19], published in November 2011, which is designed to identify and describe ({CIS}) security and cyber defense terminology and definitions to facilitate {NATO}, national, and multi-national discussion, coordination, and capability development.},

The fog brings security mechanisms near {IoT} devices reducing delays in communication, while {FL} enables a privacy-aware collaborative learning between {IoT} while preserving their privacy. {FogFed} combines two levels of detection, Fog-based {IoT} attack detection using a binary {FL} classifier and cloud-based {IoT} attack detection using a Multiclass {FL} classifier. The in-depth experiments results with wellknown {IoT} attack/malware using, the {UNSW}-{NB}15 datastet, show the significant accuracy (99\%) and detection rate (99\%), which outperforms centralized {ML}/{DL} models, while significantly reducing delays and preserving the privacy.},

	abstract = {Software-defined network ({SDN}) is widely deployed on Smart Grid ({SG}) systems. It consists in decoupling control and data planes, to automate the monitoring and management of the communication network, and thus enabling zero touch management of {SG} systems. However, {SDN}-based {SG} is prone to several security threats and varios type of new attacks. To alleviate these issues, various Machine/Deep learning ({ML}/{DL})based intrusion detection systems ({IDS}) were designed to improve the detection accuracy of conventional {IDS}. However, they suffer from high variance and/or bias, which may lead to an inaccurate security threat detection. In this context, ensemble learning is an emerging {ML} technique that aims at combining several {ML} models; the objective is to generate less data-sensitive (i.e., less variance) and more flexible (i.e., less bias) machine learning models. In this paper, we design a novel framework, called {BoostIDS}, that leverages ensemble learning to efficiently detect and mitigate security threats in {SDN}-based {SG} system. {BoostIDS} comprises two main modules: (1) A data monitoring and feature selection module that makes use of an efficient Boosting Feature Selection Algorithm to select the best/relevant {SG}-based features; and (2) An ensemble learning-based threats detection moel that implements a Lightweight Boosting Algorithm ({LBA}) to timely and effectively detects {SG}-based attacks in a {SDN} environment. We conduct extensive experiments to validate {BoostIDS} on top of multiple real attacks; the obtained results using {NSL}-{KDD} and {UNSW}-{NB}15 datasets, confirm that {BoostIDS} can effectively detect/mitigate security threats in {SDN}-based {SG} systems, while optimizing training/test time complexity.},

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective {FL}-based {NIDS}. Speciﬁcally, we leverage the characteristic of network trafﬁc data (a kind of tabular data), i.e. slight value change does not affect inherent feature, and use data binning to extract feature data on clients. The feature data are then used for training the classiﬁer on the server. We also use data masking to further enhance data protection. We evaluate our {NIDS} on the public {DDoS} attack classiﬁcation benchmark, and the result shows that our {NIDS} can achieve comparable performance as locally trained {NIDS} while signiﬁcantly reducing the communication cost.},

This complexity can be reduced by leveraging tools that enable experiment reproducibility. In this paper, we show how a recently proposed reproducibility tool called Popper facilitates the reproduction of networking experiments. In particular, we detail the steps taken to reproduce results in two published articles that rely on simulations. The outcome of this exercise is a generic workflow for carrying out network simulation experiments. In addition, we briefly present two additional Popper workflows for running experiments on controlled testbeds, as well as studies that gather real-world metrics (all code is publicly available on Github).

	abstract = {Wi-Fi has become the wireless networking standard that allows short- to medium-range device to connect without wires. For the last 20 year, the Wi-Fi technology has so pervasive that most devices in use today are mobile and connect to the internet through Wi-Fi. Unlike wired network, a wireless network lacks a clear boundary, which leads to signiﬁcant Wi-Fi network security concerns, especially because the current security measures are prone to several types of intrusion. To address this problem, machine learning and deep learning methods have been successfully developed to identify network attacks. However, collecting data to develop models is expensive and raises privacy concerns. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a federated learning approach that would alleviate such privacy concerns. This initial work on intrusion detection is performed in a simulated environment. Once proven feasible, this process would allow edge devices to collaboratively update global anomaly detection models, without sharing sensitive training data. On a set of tests with the {AWID} intrusion detection data set, we show that our federated approach is effective in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy, computation cost, as well as communication cost.},

	abstract = {Once users have shared their data online, it is generally difficult for them to revoke access and ask for the data to be deleted. Machine learning ({ML}) exacerbates this problem because any model trained with said data may have memorized it, putting users at risk of a successful privacy attack exposing their information. Yet, having models unlearn is notoriously difficult.We introduce {SISA} training, a framework that expedites the unlearning process by strategically limiting the influence of a data point in the training procedure. While our framework is applicable to any learning algorithm, it is designed to achieve the largest improvements for stateful algorithms like stochastic gradient descent for deep neural networks. {SISA} training reduces the computational overhead associated with unlearning, even in the worst-case setting where unlearning requests are made uniformly across the training set. In some cases, the service provider may have a prior on the distribution of unlearning requests that will be issued by users. We may take this prior into account to partition and order data accordingly, and further decrease overhead from unlearning.Our evaluation spans several datasets from different domains, with corresponding motivations for unlearning. Under no distributional assumptions, for simple learning tasks, we observe that {SISA} training improves time to unlearn points from the Purchase dataset by 4.63×, and 2.45× for the {SVHN} dataset, over retraining from scratch. {SISA} training also provides a speed-up of 1.36× in retraining for complex learning tasks such as {ImageNet} classification; aided by transfer learning, this results in a small degradation in accuracy. Our work contributes to practical data governance in machine unlearning.},

In the health domain, and especially for remote healthcare monitoring systems, the management of data in real time becomes a requirement. Indeed, care providers need to access the vital information and sometimes the processed data in order to take timely the adequate decision. However, many issues arise in the data processing regarding real-time aspect, computational complexity and patient mobility. Therefore, Federated Learning ({FL}) engages promising technologies such as the fog and the cloud computing as well as machine learning ({ML}) and deep learning ({DL}) to address the aforementioned issues. Fog computing enables data preprocessing in proximity of medical users, exploiting patients mobile phones or personal digital assistant ({PDA}) or small-scale distributed servers. In this paper, we pinpoint the important role of the {FL}-based system within Internet of Medical Things ({IoMT}) to combat {COVID}19 pandemic. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst introduce the architecture highlighting the fog layer within the smart healthcare system. We then discuss the preprocesing tasks that could be implemented at the fog layer with a particular focus on {ML} and {DL} tasks. After that, an investigation related to the {FL} against several {COVID}19 contexts is provided. Finally, this paper explores open issues and future directions regarding the {FL} potentialities in pandemic situation.},

To this end, network administrators need to identify {IoT} devices when they join a network and detect anomalous traffic when they are compromised. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identify the {IoT} device based on the Nilsimsa hash of its traffic flow. Different from previous studies, the proposed approach does not require feature extraction from the data.

In the recent years, due to the major increase of cyber-threats, {CTI} sharing is becoming increasingly important both as a subject of research and as a concept of providing additional security to organizations. However, selecting the proper tools and platforms for {CTI} sharing, is a challenging task, that pertains to a variety of aspects. In this paper, we start by overviewing the {CTI} procedure (threat types, categories, sources and the general {CTI} life-cycle). Then, we present a set of seven high-level {CTI} plaftorm recommendations that can be used to evaluate a platform and subsequently we survey six state-of-the-art cyber-threat intelligence platforms.

These {IoT} devices come with greater threat of being attacked or compromised that could lead to Denial of Service ({DoS}) and Distributed Denial of Service ({DDoS}). The high volume of {IoT} devices with high level of heterogeneity, magnify the possibility of security threats. So far, there is no protocol to guarantee the security of {IoT} devices. But to enable resilience, continuous monitoring is required along with adaptive decision making. These challenges can be addressed with the help of Software Deﬁned Networking ({SDN}) which can effectively handle the security threats to the {IoT} devices in dynamic and adaptive manner without any burden on the {IoT} devices. In this paper, we propose an {SDN}-based secure {IoT} framework called {SoftThings} to detect abnormal behaviors and attacks as early as possible and mitigate as appropriate. Machine Learning is used at the {SDN} controller to monitor and learn the behavior of {IoT} devices over time. We have conducted experiments on Mininet emulator. Initial results show that this framework is capable to detect attacks on {IoT} with around 98\% precision.},

	abstract = {Botnets, as one of the most formidable cyber security threats, are becoming more sophisticated and resistant to detection. In spite of speciﬁc behaviors each botnet has, there exist adequate similarities inside each botnet that separate its behavior from benign trafﬁc. Several botnet detection systems have been proposed based on these similarities. However, offering a solution for differentiating botnet trafﬁc (even those using same protocol, e.g. {IRC}) from normal trafﬁc is not trivial. Extraction of features in either host or network level to model a botnet has been one of the most popular methods in botnet detection. A subset of features, usually selected based on some intuitive understanding of botnets, is used by the machine learning algorithms to classify/ cluster botnet trafﬁc. These approaches, tested against two or three botnet traces, have mostly showed satisfactory detection results. Even though, their effectiveness in detection of other botnets or real trafﬁc remains in doubt. Additionally, effectiveness of different combination of features in terms of providing more detection coverage has not been fully studied. In this paper we revisit ﬂow-based features employed in the existing botnet detection studies and evaluate their relative effectiveness. To ensure a proper evaluation we create a dataset containing a diverse set of botnet traces and background trafﬁc.},

We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools.

	abstract = {As information systems become increasingly interdependent, there is an increased need to share cybersecurity data across government agencies and companies, and within and across industrial sectors. This sharing includes threat, vulnerability and incident reporting data, among other data. For cyberattacks that include socio-technical vectors, such as phishing or watering hole attacks, this increased sharing could expose customer and employee personal data to increased privacy risk. In the {US}, privacy risk arises when the government voluntarily receives data from companies without meaningful consent from individuals, or without a lawful procedure that protects an individual's right to due process. In this paper, we describe a study to examine the trade-off between the need for potentially sensitive data, which we call incident data usage, and the perceived privacy risk of sharing that data with the government. The study is comprised of two parts: a data usage estimate built from a survey of 76 security professionals with mean eight years' experience; and a privacy risk estimate that measures privacy risk using an ordinal likelihood scale and nominal data types in factorial vignettes. The privacy risk estimate also factors in data purposes with different levels of societal benefit, including terrorism, imminent threat of death, economic harm, and loss of intellectual property. The results show which data types are high-usage, low-risk versus those that are low-usage, high-risk. We discuss the implications of these results and recommend future work to improve privacy when data must be shared despite the increased risk to privacy.},

We prove that it can get the best of both worlds: compressed gradients and {SGD}-level convergence rate. The relative ₁/₂ geometry of gradients, noise and curvature informs whether {signSGD} or {SGD} is theoretically better suited to a particular problem. On the practical side we find that the momentum counterpart of {signSGD} is able to match the accuracy and convergence speed of Adam on deep Imagenet models. We extend our theory to the distributed setting, where the parameter server uses majority vote to aggregate gradient signs from each worker enabling 1-bit compression of worker-server communication in both directions. Using a theorem by Gauss we prove that majority vote can achieve the same reduction in variance as full precision distributed {SGD}. Thus, there is great promise for sign-based optimisation schemes to achieve fast communication and fast convergence.

Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the confidentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous Attribute-Based Encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user's keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user's credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as Role-Based Access Control ({RBAC}). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements. ©2007 {IEEE}.},

Cybersecurity Information Exchange ({CYBEX}) is one of the important platforms which has been playing an important role in implementing proactive cyber defense system by allowing organizations sharing their cybersecurity information. However, they are centralized and therefore they may suffer from complete failure in case of any damage or accident. Moreover, while sharing private information it lacks the mechanism of providing rights to query organizations i.e., enabling the access control over the shared sensitive information. Finally, nonrepudiation of the system does not exist i.e., there is no way to track or keep the record what any organization is sharing and it is necessary to keep the record in case anyone denies after sharing false information. To address these issues, in this paper we propose blockchain based privacy preserving cybersecurity information sharing using proxy re-encryption and attribute-based encryption ({BloCyNfo}-Share) where the organization can achieve fine-grain access control by delegating which organization can have the access to its cybersecurity information leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology. We conduct privacy and experimental analysis of the proposed system and the findings show that the model is private as well as efficient.},

	abstract = {To secure cyber infrastructure against intentional and potentially malicious threats, a growing collaborative effort between cybersecurity professionals and researchers from institutions, private industries, academia, and government agencies has engaged in exploiting and designing a variety of cyber defense systems. Cybersecurity researchers and designers aim to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information management systems through various cyber defense systems that protect computers and networks from hackers who may want to steal financial, medical, or other identity-based information. The Cooperative Cyber-defense has been recognized as an essential strategy to fight against cyberattacks. Cyber-security information sharing among various organizations and leveraging the aggregated cyber information to build proactive cyber defense system is nontrivial for organizations. However, building such cyber defense system is challenged by two issues: (1) organizations are reluctant to share their private information to others (2) even when they agree on a solution where information can be shared in privacy preserving manner, the obfuscated cyber threat information has to be processed to build the trained model for future prediction of any new or unknown cyber incident. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a privacy preserving protocol where organizations can share their private information as an encrypted form with others and they can learn the information for future prediction without disclosing any private information. More specifically we propose a privacy preserving decision tree algorithm, where each organization can build and learn the decision tree based on overall organizations' training spam/ham email data without disclosing any private information of any party. Once the building of a decision tree is done, the organizations can predict if any new email is spam or ham locally.},

It consists to analyzing the network trafﬁc in order to distinguish the normal behaviour from the abnormal one. This approach is usually implemented in a central server where all the network trafﬁc is analyzed which can rise privacy issues. In fact, with the increasing adoption of Cloud infrastructures, it is important to reduce as much as possible the outsourcing of such sensitive information to the several network nodes. A better approach is to ask each node to analyze its own data and then to exchange its learning ﬁnding (model) with a coordinator. In this paper, we investigate the application of federated learning for networkbased intrusion detection. Our experiment was conducted based on the {CICIDS}2017 dataset. We present a f ederated learning on a deep learning algorithm {CNN} based on model averaging. It is a self-learning system for detecting anomalies caused by malicious adversaries without human intervention and can cope with new and unknown attacks without decreasing performance. These experimentation demonstrate that this approach is effective in detecting intrusion.},

	abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

There are however, many challenges that arise while developing a powerful {IDS} for unexpected and irregular attacks. Deep Learning approaches provide several methods, and they can detect known and unknown attacks. Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network ({RNN}) and has the ability to remember values over arbitrary intervals. {LSTM} is a suitable method to classify and predict known and unknown intrusions. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to construct an {IDS}. We apply {LSTM} {RNNs} and train the model using the {CSIC} 2010 {HTTP} dataset.

To address this issue, we propose {AnKLe} (for Attack-tolerant enhanced Kullback-Leibler divergence Estimator), a novel algorithm for estimating the {KL} divergence of an observed stream compared to the expected one. {AnKLe} combines sampling techniques and information-theoretic methods. It is very efficient, both in terms of space and time complexities, and requires only a single pass over the data stream. Experimental results show that the estimation provided by {AnKLe} remains accurate even for different adversarial settings for which the quality of other methods dramatically decreases. © 2012 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {The context of this work is the online characterization of errors in large scale systems. In particular, we address the following question: Given two successive configurations of the system, can we distinguish massive errors from isolated ones, the former ones impacting a large number of nodes while the second ones affect solely a small number of them, or even a single one? The rationale of this question is twofold. First, from a theoretical point of view, we characterize errors with respect to their neighbourhood, and we show that there are error scenarios for which isolated and massive errors are indistinguishable from an omniscient observer point of view. We then relax the definition of this problem by introducing unresolved configurations, and exhibit necessary and sufficient conditions that allow any node to determine the type of errors it has been impacted by. These conditions only depend on the close neighbourhood of each node and thus are locally computable. We present algorithms that implement these conditions, and show through extensive simulations, their performances. Now from a practical point of view, distinguishing isolated errors from massive ones is of utmost importance for networks providers. For instance, for Internet service providers that operate millions of home gateways, it would be very interesting to have procedures that allow gateways to self distinguish whether their dysfunction is caused by network-level errors or by their own hardware or software, and to notify the service provider only in the latter case.},

Knowledge sharing in online communities requires exerting time and effort and hence community members need motivation to contribute in these communities. Prior research identified numerous incentives that can motivate knowledge sharing in online communities such as self-efficacy and trust. However, research did not consider the effects of community types on the effectiveness of these incentives. In this paper we use meta-analysis to examine the effects of community type on knowledge sharing incentives in communities of interest and communities of practice. We examined 24 papers focusing on knowledge sharing incentives and we found that the type of online community moderates the effects of trust, commitment, task enjoyment and reciprocity on knowledge sharing. The outcome of this research demonstrates that future research should consider community types in knowledge sharing models. © 2014 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) systems are rightly receiving considerable interest for many real-world applications, from in-body networks to satellite networks. Such a massive-scale system generates a considerable amount of traffic data, making {IoT} systems a distributed data source generator. For many reasons, such as the functionality of {IoT} applications and Quality of Service ({QoS}) provisioning, classifying these traffic data is of high importance. In the last few years, widespread interest has been expressed in applying Machine Learning ({ML})-based techniques for Network Traffic Classification ({NTC}) tasks. However, the traditional centralized learning-based traffic classifiers pose serious challenges, especially in {IoT} networks. The centralized {ML} techniques call for collecting a large amount of data from various {IoT} devices, which in turn introduces data governance and privacy challenges. Furthermore, in the centralized {ML}, training data need to be transferred to the Cloud, which increases communication cost and latency. To address these problems, we propose Federated Learning ({FL}) Internet of Things ({IoT}) Traffic Classifier ({FLITC})-a Federated Learning ({FL})-based {IoT} traffic classification method which is based on the Multi-Layer Perception ({MLP}) neural network and holds the local data unimpaired on {IoT} devices by sending only the learned parameters to the aggregation server. Our experimental results show that the {FLITC} beats centralized learning in preserving the privacy of sensitive data and offers a better degree of accuracy at the cost of a longer training time.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is being embraced by information security researchers and organizations alike for its potential in detecting attacks that an organization faces, speciﬁcally attacks that go undetected by traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems. Along with the ability to process large amounts of data, machine learning brings the potential to detect contextual and collective anomalies, an essential attribute of an ideal threat detection system. Datasets play a vital role in developing machine learning models that are capable of detecting complex and sophisticated threats like Advanced Persistent Threats ({APT}). However, there is currently no {APT}-dataset that can be used for modeling and detecting {APT} attacks. Characterized by the sophistication involved and the determined nature of the {APT} attackers, these threats are not only diﬃcult to detect but also to model. Generic intrusion datasets have three key limitations - (1) They capture attack traﬃc at the external endpoints, limiting their usefulness in the context of {APTs} which comprise of attack vectors within the internal network as well (2) The diﬀerence between normal and anomalous behavior is quiet distinguishable in these datasets and thus fails to represent the sophisticated attackers’ of {APT} attacks (3) The data imbalance in existing datasets do not reﬂect the real-world settings rendering themselves as a benchmark for supervised models and falling short of semi-supervised learning. To address these concerns, in this paper, we propose a dataset {DAPT} 2020 which consists of attacks that are part of Advanced Persistent Threats ({APT}). These attacks (1) are hard to distinguish from normal traﬃc ﬂows but investigate the raw feature space and (2) comprise of traﬃc on both public-to-private interface and the internal (private) network. Due to the existence of severe class imbalance, we benchmark {DAPT} 2020 dataset on semi-supervised models and show that they perform poorly trying to detect attack traﬃc in the various stages of an {APT}.},

	abstract = {Supervisory control and data acquisition ({SCADA}) systems monitor and control physical processes associated with the critical infrastructure. Weaknesses in the application layer protocols, however, leave {SCADA} networks vulnerable to attack. In response, cyber security researchers have developed myriad intrusion detection systems. Researchers primarily rely on unique threat models and the corresponding network traﬃc data sets to train and validate their intrusion detection systems. This leads to a situation in which researchers cannot independently verify the results, cannot compare the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent instruction detection systems, and cannot adequately validate the ability of intrusion detection systems to detect various classes of attacks. Indeed, a common data set is needed that can be used by researchers to compare intrusion detection approaches and implementations. This paper describes four data sets, which include network traﬃc, process control and process measurement features from a set of 28 attacks against two laboratory-scale industrial control systems that use the {MODBUS} application layer protocol. The data sets, which are freely available, enable eﬀective comparisons of intrusion detection solutions for {SCADA} systems.},

The highly modular architecture allows the system to be expanded with adapters for various types of networks.

Many researchers proposed various anomaly detection techniques to identify events that are inconsistent with past observations. While supervised learning is often used to that end, security experts generally do not have labeled datasets and labeling their data would be excessively expensive. Unsupervised learning, that does not require labeled data should then be used preferably, even if these approaches have led to less relevant results. We introduce in this paper a uniﬁed and unique graph representation called security objects’ graphs. This representation mixes and links events of diﬀerent kinds and allows a rich description of the activities to be analyzed. To detect anomalies in these graphs, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on auto-encoder. Our hypothesis is that as security objects’ graphs bring a rich vision of the normal situation, an auto-encoder is able to build a relevant model of this situation. To validate this hypothesis, we apply our approach to the {CICIDS}2017 dataset and show that although our approach is unsupervised, its detection results are as good, and even better than those obtained by many supervised approaches.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach for computing models over data collected by edge devices. Most importantly, the data itself is not collected centrally, but a master-worker architecture is applied where a master node performs aggregation and the edge devices are the workers, not unlike the parameter server approach. Gossip learning also assumes that the data remains at the edge devices, but it requires no aggregation server or any central component. In this empirical study, we present a thorough comparison of the two approaches. We examine the aggregated cost of machine learning in both cases, considering also a compression technique applicable in both approaches. We apply a real churn trace as well collected over mobile phones, and we also experiment with diﬀerent distributions of the training data over the devices. Surprisingly, gossip learning actually outperforms federated learning in all the scenarios where the training data are distributed uniformly over the nodes, and it performs comparably to federated learning overall.},

	abstract = {The digitalization of business processes increasingly exposes organizations to sophisticated cyber-security threats. To contain attacks and minimize their impact, it is essential to detect them early. To this end, it is necessary to analyze a wide range of log ﬁles that potentially provide clues about malicious activity. However, these logs are typically voluminous, heterogeneous, diﬃcult to interpret, and stored in disparate locations, which makes it diﬃcult to analyze them. Current approaches to analyze security logs mainly focus on regular expressions and statistical indicators and do not directly provide actionable insight to security analysts. To address these limitations, we propose a distributed approach that enables semantic querying of dispersed log sources in large-scale infrastructures. To automatically integrate and reason about security log information, we will leverage linked data technologies and state-ofthe-art federated query processing systems. In this proposal, we discuss the research problem, methodology, approach and evaluation plan for scalable federated semantic security log analysis.},

At present, a large amount of data is generated by the massive edge network in the smart city, but the resources of the edge side are limited. How to reduce the communication overhead between the edge and the centralized cloud server, improve the convergence speed of data model, and avoid resource waste caused by synchronized blocking of federated learning has become the core issue for the integration of federated learning and the Internet of Things in the smart city. For this reason, this paper designs a multi-level federated learning mechanism in the smart city, and uses reinforcement learning agents to select nodes to offset the inﬂuence of the non-{IID} data that is not independent and identically distributed. At the same time, asynchronous nonblocking updating method is used to perform model aggregation and updating of federated learning to release the resources of faster devices and improving the efﬁciency and stability of federated learning. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the efﬁciency of federated learning tasks in edge network scenarios with a lot of devices in the smart city.},

Various machine learning methods have been proposed for ﬁnding an eﬀective solution to detect and prevent network intrusions. Many approaches, tuned and tested by means of public datasets, capitalize on well-known classiﬁers, which often reach detection accuracy close to 1. However, these results strongly depend on the training data, which may not be representative of real production environments and ever-evolving attacks. This paper is an initial exploration around this problem. After having learned a detector on the top of a public intrusion detection dataset, we test it against held-out data not used for learning and additional data gathered by attack emulation in a controlled network. The experiments presented are focused on Denial of Service attacks and based on the {CICIDS}2017 dataset.

Then, we describe our efforts in mapping these tasks to a hardware platform using {COTS} components including Intel {IXP} network processors and Xilinx Virtex {FPGAs}.

Information theoretic co-clustering algorithm is advantageous over regular clustering for creating more ﬁne-grained representation of the data, however lacks the ability to handle mixed attribute data.

	abstract = {The rise in popularity of Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices has attracted hackers to develop {IoT}-speciﬁc attacks. The microservice architecture of {IoT} devices relies on the Internet to provide their intended services. An unguarded {IoT} network makes inter-connected devices vulnerable to attacks. It will be a tedious and ineffective process to manually detect the attacks in the network, as the attackers frequently upgrade their attack strategies. Machine learning ({ML})-assisted approaches have been proposed to build intrusion detection for cybersecurity automation in {IoT} networks. However, most such approaches focus on training an {ML} model using a single view of the dataset, which often fails to build insightful knowledge and understand each feature’s impact on the {ML} model’s decision-making ability. As such, the model training with a single view may result in an incomplete understanding of patterns in large feature-set datasets. Moreover, the current approaches are mainly designed in a centralized manner in which the raw data is transferred from the edge devices to the central server for training. This, in turn, may expose the data to all kinds of attacks without adhering to the privacy-preserving of data security. Multi-view learning has gained popularity for its ability to learn from different data views and deliver efﬁcient performance with more distinguished predictions. This paper proposes a federated learning-based intrusion detection approach, called {MV}-{FLID}, that trains on multiple views of {IoT} network data in a decentralized format to detect, classify, and defend against attacks. The multi-view ensemble learning aspect helps in maximizing the learning efﬁciency of different classes of attacks. The Federated Learning ({FL}) aspect, wherein the device’s data is not shared to the server, performs proﬁle aggregation efﬁciently with the beneﬁt of peer learning. Our evaluation results show that our proposed approach has higher accuracy compared to the traditional non-{FL} centralized approach.},

	abstract = {The networking of industrial cyber-physical systems ({CPSs}) brings more security threats, which highlights the significance of intrusion detection frameworks. However, the data of industrial {CPSs} have the problem of islanding and high sensitivity. As a distributed machine learning technique, the federate learning ({FL}) framework alleviates this situation by allowing detection models to be constructed collaboratively with multiple agents while protecting data privacy. However, existing {FL}-based intrusion detection methods perform ineffectively on the poisoning attacks launched by malicious agents. The poisoning attacks can manipulate the local data set to send malicious updates to the server, thus corrupting the intrusion detection model. To address these issues, we design {TICPS}, a collaborative intrusion detection framework based on a trustworthy model update strategy to detect cyber threats from industrial {CPSs}. The framework utilizes {FL} to allow multiple industrial {CPSs} to jointly construct a comprehensive intrusion detection model. In addition, we evaluate the trustworthiness of each industrial agent by similarity tests between local model updates and a trustworthy root model update. By implementing secure model aggregation updates, the models can perform effective intrusion detection even under poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments on real industrial {CPSs} datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in detecting various types of cyber threats to industrial {CPSs}. In particular, when the proportion of malicious agents reaches 90\% under three typical poisoning attacks, it can still achieve 94\% accuracy of intrusion detection.},

	abstract = {Edge computing allows constrained end devices in wireless networks to offioad heavy computing tasks or data storage when local resources are insufficient. Edge nodes can provide resources such as the bandwidth, storage and innetwork compute power. For example, edge nodes can provide data caches to which constrained end devices can off-load their data and from where user can access data more effectively. However, fair allocation of these resources to competing end devices and data classes while providing good Quality of Service is a challenging task, due to frequently changing network topology and/or traffic conditions. In this paper, we present Federated learning-based dynamic Cache allocation ({FedCache}) for edge caches in dynamic, constrained networks. {FedCache} uses federated learning to learn the benefit of a particular cache allocation with low communication overhead. Edge nodes learn locally to adapt to different network conditions and collaboratively share this knowledge so as to avoid having to transmit all data to a single location. Through this federated learning approach, nodes can find resource allocations that result in maximum fairness or efficiency in terms of the cache hit ratio for a given network state. Simulation results show that cache resource allocation using {FedCache} results in optimal fairness or efficiency of utility for different classes of data when compared to proportional allocation, while incurring low communication overhead.},

The multitude of services and technologies that 5G incorporates have made modern communication networks very complex and sophisticated in nature. This complexity along with the incorporation of Machine Learning ({ML}) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence ({AI}) provides the opportunity for the attackers to launch intelligent attacks against the network and network devices. These attacks often traverse undetected due to the lack of intelligent security mechanisms to counter these threats. Therefore, the implementation of real-time, proactive, and self-adaptive security mechanisms throughout the network would be an integral part of 5G as well as future communication systems. Therefore, large amounts of data collected from real networks will play an important role in the training of {AI}/{ML} models to identify and detect malicious content in network trafﬁc.

The {CSE}-{CIC} {IDS} datasets published in 2017 and 2018 have both attracted considerable scholarly attention towards research in intrusion detection systems. Recent work published using this dataset indicates little attention paid to the imbalance of the dataset. The study presented in this paper sets out to explore the degree to which imbalance has been treated and provide a taxonomy of the machine learning approaches developed using these datasets. A survey of published works related to these datasets was done to deliver a combined qualitative and quantitative methodological approach for our analysis towards deriving a taxonomy. The research presented here confirms that the impact of bias due to the imbalance datasets is rarely addressed. This data supports further research and development of supervised machine learning techniques which reduce the impact of bias in classification or prediction due to these imbalance datasets.},

As machine learning, federated learning is threatened by adversarial attacks against the integrity of the learning model and the privacy of data via a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning. This weak point is exacerbated by the inaccessibility of data in federated learning, which makes the protection against adversarial attacks harder and evidences the need to furtherance the research on defence methods to make federated learning a real solution for safeguarding data privacy. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the threats of federated learning, as well as as their corresponding countermeasures, attacks versus defences.

However, {ML} is currently unable to integrate cybersecurity information into its inner workings. This paper introduces Cyber Informedness, a new metric taking into account cybersecurity information to give a more informed representation of performance, influenced by the severity of the attacks encountered. This metric uses a de facto standard in cybersecurity: the Common Vulnerability Scoring System ({CVSS}). Results on two public datasets show that this new metric validates results obtained with generic metrics. Furthermore, this new metric highlights {ML}-based {IDSs} that prioritize high performance on severe attacks, which is not visible with generic metrics. Consequently, this new metric nicely completes generic metrics by bridging the gap between {ML} and cybersecurity.},

	abstract = {Access to sufficient annotated data is a common challenge in training deep neural networks on medical images. As annotating data is expensive and time-consuming, it is difficult for an individual medical center to reach large enough sample sizes to build their own, personalized models. As an alternative, data from all centers could be pooled to train a centralized model that everyone can use. However, such a strategy is often infeasible due to the privacy-sensitive nature of medical data. Recently, federated learning ({FL}) has been introduced to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model across centers without the need for sharing data. In {FL}, clients are locally training models on site-specific datasets for a few epochs and then sharing their model weights with a central server, which orchestrates the overall training process. Importantly, the sharing of models does not compromise patient privacy. A disadvantage of {FL} is the dependence on a central server, which requires all clients to agree on one trusted central body, and whose failure would disrupt the training process of all clients. In this paper, we introduce {BrainTorrent}, a new {FL} framework without a central server, particularly targeted towards medical applications. {BrainTorrent} presents a highly dynamic peer-to-peer environment, where all centers directly interact with each other without depending on a central body. We demonstrate the overall effectiveness of {FL} for the challenging task of whole brain segmentation and observe that the proposed server-less {BrainTorrent} approach does not only outperform the traditional server-based one but reaches a similar performance to a model trained on pooled data.},

	shorttitle = {Federated Learning on Non-{IID} Data Silos},
	abstract = {Due to the increasing privacy concerns and data regulations, training data have been increasingly fragmented, forming distributed databases of multiple “data silos” (e.g., within different organizations and countries). To develop effective machine learning services, there is a must to exploit data from such distributed databases without exchanging the raw data. Recently, federated learning ({FL}) has been a solution with growing interests, which enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without exchanging their local data. A key and common challenge on distributed databases is the heterogeneity of the data distribution among the parties. The data of different parties are usually non-independently and identically distributed (i.e., non-{IID}). There have been many {FL} algorithms to address the learning effectiveness under non-{IID} data settings. However, there lacks an experimental study on systematically understanding their advantages and disadvantages, as previous studies have very rigid data partitioning strategies among parties, which are hardly representative and thorough. In this paper, to help researchers better understand and study the non-{IID} data setting in federated learning, we propose comprehensive data partitioning strategies to cover the typical non-{IID} data cases. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate state-ofthe-art {FL} algorithms. We ﬁnd that non-{IID} does bring signiﬁcant challenges in learning accuracy of {FL} algorithms, and none of the existing state-of-the-art {FL} algorithms outperforms others in all cases. Our experiments provide insights for future studies of addressing the challenges in “data silos”.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Federated Learning ({FL}) has gained relevance in training collaborative models without sharing sensitive data. Since its birth, Centralized {FL} ({CFL}) has been the most common approach in the literature, where a central entity creates a global model. However, a centralized approach leads to increased latency due to bottlenecks, heightened vulnerability to system failures, and trustworthiness concerns affecting the entity responsible for the global model creation. Decentralized Federated Learning ({DFL}) emerged to address these concerns by promoting decentralized model aggregation and minimizing reliance on centralized architectures. However, despite the work done in {DFL}, the literature has not (i) studied the main aspects differentiating {DFL} and {CFL}; (ii) analyzed {DFL} frameworks to create and evaluate new solutions; and (iii) reviewed application scenarios using {DFL}. Thus, this article identifies and analyzes the main fundamentals of {DFL} in terms of federation architectures, topologies, communication mechanisms, security approaches, and key performance indicators. Additionally, the paper at hand explores existing mechanisms to optimize critical {DFL} fundamentals. Then, the most relevant features of the current {DFL} frameworks are reviewed and compared. After that, it analyzes the most used {DFL} application scenarios, identifying solutions based on the fundamentals and frameworks previously defined. Finally, the evolution of existing {DFL} solutions is studied to provide a list of trends, lessons learned, and open challenges.},

	abstract = {Federated learning has been widely studied and applied to various scenarios, such as financial credit, medical identification, and so on. Under these settings, federated learning protects users from exposing their private data, while cooperatively training a shared machine learning algorithm model (i.e., the global model) for a variety of realworld applications. The only data exchanged is the gradient of the model or the updated model (i.e., the local model update). However, the security of federated learning is increasingly being questioned, due to the malicious clients or central servers' constant attack on the global model or user privacy data. To address these security issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain, that is, a Block-chain-based Federated Learning framework with Committee consensus ({BFLC}). Without a centralized server, the framework uses blockchain for the global model storage and the local model update exchange. To enable the proposed {BFLC}, we also devise an innovative committee consensus mechanism, which can effectively reduce the amount of consensus computing and reduce malicious attacks. We then discuss the scalability of {BFLC}, including theoretical security, storage optimization, and incentives. Finally, based on a {FISCO} blockchain system, we perform experiments using an {AlexNet} model on several frameworks with a real-world dataset {FEMNIST}. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and security of the {BFLC} framework.},

We present D-Cliques, a novel topology that reduces gradient bias by grouping nodes in interconnected cliques such that the local joint distribution in a clique is representative of the global class distribution. We also show how to adapt the updates of decentralized {SGD} to obtain unbiased gradients and implement an effective momentum with D-Cliques. Our empirical evaluation on {MNIST} and {CIFAR}10 demonstrates that our approach provides similar convergence speed as a fully-connected topology with a significant reduction in the number of edges and messages. In a 1000-node topology, D-Cliques requires 98\% less edges and 96\% less total messages, with further possible gains using a small-world topology across cliques.},

However, in real-world federated learning scenarios the network capacities between nodes are highly uniformly distributed and smaller than that in a datacenter. It is of great challenges for conventional federated learning approaches to efficiently utilize network capacities between nodes. In this paper, we propose a model segment level decentralized federated learning to tackle this problem. In particular, we propose a segmented gossip approach, which not only makes full utilization of node-to-node bandwidth, but also has good training convergence.

However, the distributed nature of {FL} gives rise to new threats caused by potentially malicious participants. In this paper, we study targeted data poisoning attacks against {FL} systems in which a malicious subset of the participants aim to poison the global model by sending model updates derived from mislabeled data. We ﬁrst demonstrate that such data poisoning attacks can cause substantial drops in classiﬁcation accuracy and recall, even with a small percentage of malicious participants. We additionally show that the attacks can be targeted, i.e., they have a large negative impact only on classes that are under attack. We also study attack longevity in early/late round training, the impact of malicious participant availability, and the relationships between the two. Finally, we propose a defense strategy that can help identify malicious participants in {FL} to circumvent poisoning attacks, and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models have been extensively proposed for classifying network ﬂows as benign or malicious, either in-network or at the endpoints of the infrastructure. Typically, the performance of such models is assessed by evaluating the trained model against a portion of the available dataset. However, in a production scenario, these models are fed by a monitoring stage that collects information from ﬂows and provides inputs to a ﬁltering stage that eventually blocks malicious trafﬁc. To the best of our knowledge, no work has analysed the entire pipeline, focusing on its performance in terms of both inputs (i.e., the information collected from each ﬂow) and outputs (i.e., the system’s ability to prevent an attack from reaching the application layer).},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection is a key topic in computer security. Due to the ever-increasing number of network attacks, several accurate anomaly-based techniques have been proposed for intrusion detection, wherein pattern recognition through machine learning techniques is typically used. Many proposals rely on the use of autoencoders, due to their capability to analyze complex, high-dimensional, and large-scale data. They capitalize on composite architectures and accurate learning approaches, possibly in combination with sophisticated feature selection techniques. However, due to their high complexity and lack of transferability of the impressive intrusion detection results, they are hardly ever used in production environments. This paper is developed around the intuition that complexity is not necessarily justified because a single autoencoder is enough to obtain similar, if not better, intrusion detection results compared to related proposals. The wide study presented here addresses the effect of the seed, a deep investigation on the training loss, and feature selection across the use of different hardware platforms. The best practices presented, regarding set-up and training, threshold setting, and possible use of feature selection techniques for performance improvement, can be valuable for any future work on the use of autoencoders for successful intrusion detection purposes.},

The principal advantage of this class of methods is to better accommodate the real-world characteristics found in federated training, such as the lack of {IID} data across parties, the need for robustness to outliers or stragglers, and the requirement to perform well on party-specific datasets. We achieve this through a problem formulation that allows the central server to employ robust ways of aggregating the local models while keeping the structure of local computation intact. Without making any statistical assumption on the degree of heterogeneity of local data across parties, we provide convergence guarantees for Fed+ for convex and non-convex loss functions under different (robust) aggregation methods. The Fed+ theory is also equipped to handle heterogeneous computing environments including stragglers without additional assumptions; specifically, the convergence results cover the general setting where the number of local update steps across parties can vary. We demonstrate the benefits of Fed+ through extensive experiments across standard benchmark datasets.},

Future networks are expected to realise a number of tasks, including network optimization and failure recovery, with minimal human supervision. In this context, the network community (manufacturers, operators, researchers, etc.) is looking at Machine Learning ({ML}) methods with high expectations. However, {ML} models can only be as good as the data they are trained on, which means that autonomous networks also require a sound autonomous procedure to assess, and if possible improve, data quality. Although the application of {ML} techniques in communication networks is ample in the literature, analyzing the quality of the network data seems an ignored problem. This paper presents work in progress on the application of permutation testing to assess the quality of network datasets. We illustrate our approach on a number of simple synthetic datasets with pre-established quality and then we demonstrate its application in a publicly available network dataset.},

	abstract = {An intrusion detection system ({IDS}) is an important protection instrument for detecting complex network attacks. Various machine learning ({ML}) or deep learning ({DL}) algorithms have been proposed for implementing anomaly-based {IDS} ({AIDS}). Our review of the {AIDS} literature identifies some issues in related work, including the randomness of the selected algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria, the application of old datasets, or shallow analyses and validation of the results. This paper comprehensively reviews previous studies on {AIDS} by using a set of criteria with different datasets and types of attacks to set benchmarking outcomes that can reveal the suitable {AIDS} algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria. Specifically, this paper applies 10 popular supervised and unsupervised {ML} algorithms for identifying effective and efficient {ML}-{AIDS} of networks and computers. These supervised {ML} algorithms include the artificial neural network ({ANN}), decision tree ({DT}), k-nearest neighbor (k-{NN}), naive Bayes ({NB}), random forest ({RF}), support vector machine ({SVM}), and convolutional neural network ({CNN}) algorithms, whereas the unsupervised {ML} algorithms include the expectation-maximization ({EM}), k-means, and self-organizing maps ({SOM}) algorithms. Several models of these algorithms are introduced, and the turning and training parameters of each algorithm are examined to achieve an optimal classifier evaluation. Unlike previous studies, this study evaluates the performance of {AIDS} by measuring the true positive and negative rates, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score of 31 {ML}-{AIDS} models. The training and testing time for {ML}-{AIDS} models are also considered in measuring their performance efficiency given that time complexity is an important factor in {AIDSs}. The {ML}-{AIDS} models are tested by using a recent and highly unbalanced multiclass {CICIDS}2017 dataset that involves real-world network attacks. In general, the k-{NN}-{AIDS}, {DT}-{AIDS}, and {NB}-{AIDS} models obtain the best results and show a greater capability in detecting web attacks compared with other models that demonstrate irregular and inferior results.},

With the advent of big data and cloud computing technologies, lots and lots of data are being produced on the internet. Every day, petabytes of data are produced from websites, social media sites, or the internet. As more and more data are produced, a continuous threat of network attacks is also growing. An intrusion detection system ({IDS}) is used to detect such types of attacks in the network. {IDS} inspects packet headers and data and decides whether the traffic is anomalous or normal based on the contents of the packet. In this research, {ML} techniques are being used for intrusion detection purposes. Feature selection is also used for efficient and optimal feature selection. The research proposes a hybrid feature selection technique composed of the Pearson correlation coefficient and random forest model. For the machine learning ({ML}) model, decision tree, {AdaBoost}, and K-nearest neighbor are trained and tested on the {TON}\_IoT dataset. The dataset is new and contains new and recent attack types and features. For deep learning ({DL}), multilayer perceptron ({MLP}) and long short-term memory are trained and tested. Evaluation is done on the basis of accuracy, precision, and recall. It is concluded from the results that the decision tree for {ML} and {MLP} for {DL} provides optimal accuracy with fewer false-positive and false-negative rates. It is also concluded from the results that the {ML} techniques are effective for detecting intrusion in the networks.},

Through years, several of such algorithms have been proposed, evaluated experimentally, and analyzed in qualitative and quantitative surveys. However, the experimental comparison of a comprehensive set of algorithms for anomaly-based intrusion detection against a comprehensive set of attacks datasets and attack types was not investigated yet. To fill such gap, in this paper we experimentally evaluate a pool of twelve unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms on five attacks datasets. Results allow elaborating on a wide range of arguments, from the behavior of the individual algorithm to the suitability of the datasets to anomaly detection. We identify the families of algorithms that are more effective for intrusion detection, and the families that are more robust to the choice of configuration parameters. Further, we confirm experimentally that attacks with unstable and non-repeatable behavior are more difficult to detect, and that datasets where anomalies are rare events usually result in better detection scores.},

	abstract = {Network intrusion detection systems are evolving into intelligent systems that perform data analysis while searching for anomalies in their environment. Indeed, the development of deep learning techniques paved the way to build more complex and effective threat detection models. However, training those models may be computationally infeasible in most Edge or {IoT} devices. Current approaches rely on powerful centralized servers that receive data from all their parties — violating basic privacy constraints and substantially affecting response times and operational costs due to the huge communication overheads. To mitigate these issues, Federated Learning emerged as a promising approach, where different agents collaboratively train a shared model, without exposing training data to others or requiring a compute-intensive centralized infrastructure. This work presents {GöwFed}, a novel network threat detection system that combines the usage of Gower Dissimilarity matrices and Federated averaging. Different approaches of {GöwFed} have been developed based on state-of the-art knowledge: (1) a vanilla version — achieving a median point of [0.888, 0.960] in the {PR} space and a median accuracy of 0.930; and (2) a version instrumented with an attention mechanism — achieving comparable results when 0.8 of the best performing nodes contribute to the model. Furthermore, each variant has been tested using simulation oriented tools provided by {TensorFlow} Federated framework. In the same way, a centralized analogous development of the Federated systems is carried out to explore their differences in terms of scalability and performance — the median point of the experiments is [0.987, 0.987]) and the median accuracy is 0.989. Overall, {GöwFed} intends to be the first stepping stone towards the combined usage of Federated Learning and Gower Dissimilarity matrices to detect network threats in industrial-level networks.},

Aspects relating to reliance on the networking domain and the difficulty of achieving security by design pose a challenge today. As a result, data-centric and machine-learning approaches arose as feasible solutions for securing large networks. Although, in the network security domain, {ML}-based solutions face a challenge regarding the capability to generalize between different contexts. In other words, solutions based on specific network data usually do not perform satisfactorily on other networks. This paper describes the stacked-unsupervised federated learning ({FL}) approach to generalize on a cross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system ({NIDS}). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in conjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. Our approach performs better than traditional local learning and naive cross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data). Remarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case of non-{IID} data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an ensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed {FL}-based {NIDS} results in a feasible approach for generalization between heterogeneous networks.},

Challenged by the limited memory size of current {TEEs}, we leverage greedy layer-wise training to train each model’s layer inside the trusted area until its convergence. The performance evaluation of our implementation shows that 𝑃𝑃𝐹 𝐿 can significantly improve privacy while incurring small system overheads at the client-side. In particular, 𝑃𝑃𝐹 𝐿 can successfully defend the trained model against data reconstruction, property inference, and membership inference attacks. Furthermore, it can achieve comparable model utility with fewer communication rounds (0.54×) and a similar amount of network traffic (1.002×) compared to the standard federated learning of a complete model. This is achieved while only introducing up to ∼15\% {CPU} time, ∼18\% memory usage, and ∼21\% energy consumption overhead in 𝑃𝑃𝐹 𝐿’s client-side.},

However, parameter exchange may still leak information. Several approaches have been proposed to overcome this, based on multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, etc.; many of these protocols are slow and impractical for real-world use as they involve a large number of cryptographic operations. In this paper, we propose the use of Trusted Execution Environments ({TEE}), which provide a platform for isolated execution of code and handling of data, for this purpose. We describe Flatee, an eﬃcient privacy-preserving federated learning framework across {TEEs}, which considerably reduces training and communication time. Our framework can handle malicious parties (we do not natively solve adversarial data poisoning, though we describe a preliminary approach to handle this).},

In this paper, we investigate the generalisability property of {ML}-based {NIDSs} by extensively evaluating seven supervised and unsupervised learning models on four recently published benchmark {NIDS} datasets. Our investigation indicates that none of the considered models is able to generalise over all studied datasets. Interestingly, our results also indicate that the generalisability has a high degree of asymmetry, i.e., swapping the source and target domains can signiﬁcantly change the classiﬁcation performance. Our investigation also indicates that overall, unsupervised learning methods generalise better than supervised learning models in our considered scenarios. Using {SHAP} values to explain these results indicates that the lack of generalisability is mainly due to the presence of strong correspondence between the values of one or more features and Attack/Benign classes in one datasetmodel combination and its absence in other datasets that have different feature distributions.},

As opposed to the typical central training process, Federated Learning involves the collaborative training of statistical models by exchanging learned parameter updates. However, wide adoption of the technology is hindered by the communication and computation overhead forming due to the demanding computational cost of training, and the large-sized parameter updates exchanged. In popular applications such as those involving Internet of Things, the effects of the overhead are exacerbated due to the low computational prowess of edge and fog devices, limited bandwidth, and data capacity of internet connections. Over the years, many research activities that target this particular issue were conducted but a comprehensive review of the fragmented literature is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by providing a systematic review of recent work conducted to improve the communication and/or computation efficiency in Federated Learning. We begin by introducing the essentials of Federated Learning and its variations, followed by the literature review placed according to an encompassing, easy-to-follow taxonomy. Lastly, the work sheds light on the current challenges faced by the technology and possible directions for future work.},

A majority of {UAV} missions require flying through public airspace. Airspace management is a sector with very high safety standards, as can be seen with commercial civil aviation. Reliable communication links between aircraft, their pilots and {UTM} systems are necessary to safely carry out these missions. Several security properties have to be provided in order to ensure a safe traffic. Current cryptographic standards used over the internet are not suitable to Unmanned Aerial System ({UAS}), mainly due to their computational complexity. The survey discusses every communication link and assesses the security needs in order to enable a safe traffic management. We then present and discuss several research works providing the required properties using cryptographic primitives. In particular, authenticated key exchange protocols specifically developed for constrained systems are compared and evaluated as solutions for {UAS} security. We also discuss symmetric encryption alternatives to the {AES} algorithm as well as works to secure current {UTM} protocols such as {ADS}-B and {RemoteID}. The analysis reveals a lack of signature solutions, the need for the development of a complete secure architecture able to provide authentication and integrity and a need for post-quantum lightweight solutions. We then present our current work which focuses on implementing a post-quantum signature standard to evaluate its pertinence for {UAS}.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection plays an important role in network security and traffic classification. Many works have focused on anomaly detection to improve network security, including traditional machine learning ({ML}) methods and deep learning ({DL}) methods. In the process of training models, these methods often require a large number of samples and need to get the results by classifying the whole dataset, which lead to their inflexibility. Meanwhile, the model trained on one dataset cannot be transferable to another dataset. These problems limit the application of previous methods in the network security management. To address these challenges, we consider using deep reinforcement learning ({DRL}) for anomaly detection, and propose a transferable and adaptable network intrusion detection system ({TA}-{NIDS}) based on {DRL}. The interaction process between the agent and the environment is different every time. A small scale dataset can also produce a large number of interactive processes. Therefore, few-shot learning is feasible. Then, a reasonable reward function can let the agent learn to choose outliers first without classifying the whole dataset. The real-time changing environment in reinforcement learning ({RL}) is also closer to the real environment. These make {TA}-{NIDS} more adaptable for the actual scene. More importantly, the original feature is transformed into many state, so there is no requirement for the feature dimension. And the general rather than specific state of one dataset makes the model transferable to other datasets. Experiments on {IDS}2017, {IDS}2018, {NSL}-{KDD} and {UNSW}-{NB}15 show that the framework which gives priority to selecting outliers can realize few-shot learning, has high accuracy, good transferability, and it is adaptable to the actual scene.},

To ensure privacy, the server performs secure aggregation of updates from the clients. Unfortunately, this prevents verification of the well-formedness (integrity) of the updates as the updates are masked. Consequently, malformed updates designed to poison the model can be injected without detection. In this paper, we formalize the problem of ensuring both update privacy and integrity in {FL} and present a new system, {EIFFeL}, that enables secure aggregation of verified updates. {EIFFeL} is a general framework that can enforce arbitrary integrity checks and remove malformed updates from the aggregate, without violating privacy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the practicality of {EIFFeL}. For instance, with 100 clients and 10\% poisoning, {EIFFeL} can train an {MNIST} classification model to the same accuracy as that of a non-poisoned federated learner in just 2.4s per iteration.},

Unfortunately, developing a deep understanding of these issues has proven to be a challenging task, since it in turn involves solving difficult problems such as mapping the actual topology, characterizing it, and developing models that capture its emergent behavior. Consequently, even though there are a number of topology models, it is an open question as to how representative the generated topologies they generate are of the actual Internet. Our goal is to produce a topology generation framework which improves the state of the art and is based on the design principles of representativeness, inclusiveness, and interoperability. Representativeness leads to synthetic topologies that accurately reflect many aspects of the actual Internet topology (e.g. hierarchical structure, node degree distribution, etc.). Inclusiveness combines the strengths of as many generation models as possible in a single generation tool. Interoperability provides interfaces to widely-used simulation applications such as ns and {SSF} and visualization tools like otter. We call such a tool a universal topology generator.},

	abstract = {Recent empirical studies [6] have shown that Internet topologies exhibit power laws of the form y = x α for the following relationships: (P1) outdegree of node (domain or router) versus rank; (P2) number of nodes versus outdegree; (P3) number of node pairs within a neighborhood versus neighborhood size (in hops); and (P4) eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix versus rank. However, causes for the appearance of such power laws have not been convincingly given. In this paper, we examine four factors in the formation of Internet topologies. These factors are (F1) preferential connectivity of a new node to existing nodes; (F2) incremental growth of the network; (F3) distribution of nodes in space; and (F4) locality of edge connections. In synthetically generated network topologies, we study the relevance of each factor in causing the aforementioned power laws as well as other properties, namely diameter, average path length and clustering coefficient. Different kinds of network topologies are generated: (T1) topologies generated using our parametrized generator, we call {BRITE}; (T2) random topologies generated using the well-known Waxman model [12]; (T3) Transit-Stub topologies generated using {GT}-{ITM} tool [3]; and (T4) regular grid topologies. We observe that some generated topologies may not obey power laws P1 and P2. Thus, the existence of these power laws can be used to validate the accuracy of a given tool in generating representative Internet topologies. Power laws P3 and P4 were observed in nearly all considered topologies, but different topologies showed different values of the power exponent α. Thus, while the presence of power laws P3 and P4 do not give strong evidence for the representativeness of a generated topology, the value of α in P3 and P4 can be used as a litmus test for the representativeness of a generated topology. We also find that factors F1 and F2 are the key contributors in our study which provide the resemblance of our generated topologies to that of the Internet.},

To address this issue, this paper introduces the notion of environment transposition and implements it in {NixOS} Compose, a tool that generates reproducible distributed environments. It enables users to deploy their environments on virtualized (docker, {QEMU}) or physical (Grid'5000) platforms with the same unique description of the environment. We show that {NixOS} Compose enables to build reproducible environments without overhead by comparing it to state-of-the-art solutions for the generation of distributed environments ({EnOSlib} and Kameleon). {NixOS} Compose actually enables substantial performance improvements on image building time over Kameleon (up to 11x faster for initial builds and up to 19x faster when building a variation of an existing environment).},

	abstract = {Real-time machine learning ({ML}) has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential to support instantaneous learning, adaptation, and decision making in a wide range of application domains, including self-driving vehicles, intelligent transportation, and industry automation. In this paper, we investigate real-time {ML} in a federated edge intelligence ({FEI}) system, an edge computing system that implements federated learning ({FL}) solutions based on data samples collected and uploaded from decentralized data networks, e.g., Internet-of-Things ({IoT}) and/or wireless sensor networks. {FEI} systems often exhibit heterogenous communication and computational resource distribution, as well as non-i.i.d. data samples arrived at different edge servers, resulting in long model training time and inefficient resource utilization. Motivated by this fact, we propose a time-sensitive federated learning ({TS}-{FL}) framework to minimize the overall run-time for collaboratively training a shared {ML} model with desirable accuracy. Training acceleration solutions for both {TS}-{FL} with synchronous coordination ({TS}-{FL}-{SC}) and asynchronous coordination ({TS}-{FL}-{ASC}) are investigated. To address the straggler effect in {TS}-{FL}-{SC}, we develop an analytical solution to characterize the impact of selecting different subsets of edge servers on the overall model training time. A server dropping-based solution is proposed to allow some slow-performance edge servers to be removed from participating in the model training if their impact on the resulting model accuracy is limited. A joint optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize the overall time consumption of model training by selecting participating edge servers, the local epoch number (the number of model training iterations per coordination), and the data batch size (the number of data samples for each model training iteration). Motivated by the fact that data samples at the slowest edge server may exhibit special characteristics that cannot be removed from model training, we develop an analytical expression to characterize the impact of both staleness effect of asynchronous coordination and straggler effect of {FL} on the time consumption of {TS}-{FL}-{ASC}. We propose a load forwarding-based solution that allows a slow edge server to offload part of its training samples to trusted edge servers with higher processing capability. We develop a hardware prototype to evaluate the model training time of a heterogeneous {FEI} system. Experimental results show that our proposed {TS}-{FL}-{SC} and {TS}-{FL}-{ASC} can provide up to 63\% and 28\% of reduction, in the overall model training time, respectively, compared with traditional {FL} solutions.},

There are many attempts of adopting Machine Learning ({ML}) in {IDS} to achieve high performance in intrusion detection. However, all of them necessitate a large amount of labeled data. In addition, labeling attack data is a time-consuming and expensive human-labor operation, it makes existing {ML} methods difficult to deploy in a new system or yields lower results due to a lack of labels on pre-trained data.

	abstract = {Reconciling machine learning with individual privacy is one of the main motivations behind federated learning ({FL}), a decentralized machine learning technique that aggregates partial models trained by clients on their own private data to obtain a global deep learning model. Even if {FL} provides stronger privacy guarantees to the participating clients than centralized learning collecting the clients’ data in a central server, {FL} is vulnerable to some attacks whereby malicious clients submit bad updates in order to prevent the model from converging or, more subtly, to introduce artificial bias in the classification (poisoning). Poisoning detection techniques compute statistics on the updates to identify malicious clients. A downside of anti-poisoning techniques is that they might lead to discriminate minority groups whose data are significantly and legitimately different from those of the majority of clients. This would not only be unfair, but would yield poorer models that would fail to capture the knowledge in the training data, especially when data are not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). In this work, we strive to strike a balance between fighting poisoning and accommodating diversity to help learning fairer and less discriminatory federated learning models. In this way, we forestall the exclusion of diverse clients while still ensuring detection of poisoning attacks. Empirical work on three data sets shows that employing our approach to tell legitimate from malicious updates produces models that are more accurate than those obtained with state-of-the-art poisoning detection techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of our proposal on the performance of models on non-i.i.d local training data.},

	abstract = {Personalized federated learning ({PFL}) aims to train model(s) that can perform well on the individual edge-devices' data where the edge-devices (clients) are usually {IoT} devices like our mobile phones. The participating clients for cross-device settings, in general, have heterogeneous system capabilities and limited communication bandwidth. Such practical properties of the edge-devices, however, are overlooked by many recent work in {PFL}, which use the same model architecture across all clients and incur high communication cost by directly communicating the model parameters. In our work, we propose a novel and practical {PFL} framework named {COMET} where clients can use heterogeneous models of their own choice and do not directly communicate their model parameters to other parties. Instead, {COMET} uses clustered codistillation, where clients use knowledge distillation to transfer their knowledge to other clients with similar data distributions. This presents a practical {PFL} framework for the edge-devices to train through {IoT} networks by lifting the heavy communication burden of communicating large models. We theoretically show the convergence and generalization properties of {COMET} and empirically show that {COMET} achieves high test accuracy with several orders of magnitude lower communication cost while allowing client model heterogeneity compared to the other state-of-the-art {PFL} methods.},

In order to resolve these issues, we proposed a heterogeneous federated learning algorithm based on blockchain and model distillation. The problem of fully heterogeneous models that are hard to aggregate in the central server can be solved by leveraging model distillation technology. Moreover, blockchain replaces the central server in federated learning to solve the single-point-of-failure problem. The validation algorithm is combined with cross-validation, which helps federated learning to resist poison attacks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that {HBMD}-{FL} can resist poisoning attacks while losing less than 3\$\${\textbackslash}\%\$\$of model accuracy, and the communication consumption significantly outperformed the comparison algorithm.},

However, the data distribution is different for each edge nodes, which limits the effectiveness of federated learning models. We focus on the non-{IID} data features and propose a new cluster-based federated learning framework for network intrusion detection. In this method, we cluster clients into different communities by data labels, which the clients contain the similar proportion of data labels in the same community. Based on the clustering results, we decompose federated learning model aggregation into cluster aggregation and global aggregation by leveraging similarities both within and between clusters. We conduct extensive experiments based on {UNSW}\_NB15 dataset. The results show that our method has better performance than {FedAvg} and {FedProx}.

To guard against this, we develop a robust aggregation scheme based on subjective logic and residual-based attack detection. Employing a combination of theoretical analysis, trace-driven simulation, as well as experimental validation with a prototype and real users, we show that our classifier can detect sensitive content with high accuracy, learn new labels fast, and remain robust in view of poisoning attacks from malicious users, as well as imperfect input from non-malicious ones.},

	abstract = {With the development of computer software, the amount of network data has increased geometrically. Therefore, how to quickly identify attacks from a large amount of network information is a meaningful research direction. The intrusion detection system ({IDS}) is the core contributor to protecting the host from attack. It can distinguish the characteristics of intrusion behavior and the intrusion action from the data of the host. However, with the huge increase in the amount of data now, the efficiency of identifying data characteristics is getting lower and lower. In addition, smart terminal equipment such as notebooks, smart phones and wearable devices are also emerging, and these devices are connected to the internet through wireless or wired means. The physical data generated by terminal equipment involves huge amount of personal sensitive data, which poses a challenge to data privacy and security. Federated learning, as a new type of distributed learning framework, allows training data to be shared among multiple participants without revealing their data privacy. In order to solve the problem of privacy data in intrusion detection,, this paper proposes a network intrusion detection method based on federated learning and conducting experiments on the {UNSW}-{NB}15 dataset and {CICIDS}2018 dataset.

However, using classical centralized learning algorithms in the {IoT} environment is challenging, given massively distributed private datasets. Advancements in {AI} have helped us solve various use cases, but it operates under two significant challenges. Firstly, the data exists in separate clusters, and secondly, the current {AI} has limited data privacy and security. Federated learning ({FL}) aims to preserve data privacy through distributed learning methods that keep the data in storage silos. Likewise, differential privacy improves data privacy by measuring the privacy loss in communication among the elements of {FL}. The paper proposes two adaptive approaches for making model training differentially private in a vertical federated environment. The first one uses random feature selection to train different machine learning models, and performance improvement is also proposed. The second approach uses a tree structure, i.e., Classification and Regression Trees, using some defined constraints. Further, we created a scheme to help identify malicious users/devices in a federated network cluster using parity checks for every {FL} iteration.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the growth and pervasiveness of Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices have led to increased attacks by hackers and attackers. On the other hand, using {IoT} infrastructure in various fields has increased the number of node security breaches, attacks, and anomalies. Therefore, detecting anomalies in {IoT} devices is vital to reduce attacks and strengthen security. Over the past few years, various research has been conducted in anomaly-based intrusion detection using machine learning and deep learning methods. The biggest challenge in machine learning methods is the inability to extract new features. To do this, researchers use deep learning methods to extract new features that lead to increased accuracy in intrusion detection. There are important unsolved challenges in research, including determining important features in detecting malicious attacks, extracting features from raw network traffic data using deep networks, and insufficient accuracy in detecting attacks against {IoT} devices. Convolutional neural networks are considered a powerful and reliable method in this field due to the ability to automatically extract features from data and perform faster calculations. This study has designed and implemented the {IoT} features extraction convolutional neural network called {IoTFECNN} with hybrid layers for better anomaly detection in the {IoT}. Moreover, a binary multi-objective enhanced Capuchin Search Algorithm ({CSA}) called {BMECapSA} is developed for efficient feature selection. The combination of the {IoTFECNN} and {BMECapSA} methods has led to the introduction of a new hybrid method called {CNN}-{BMECapSA}-{RF}. Finally, the proposed method is implemented and tested on two data sets, {NSL}-{KDD} and {TON}-{IoT}. The results of various experiments exhibit that the proposed method has better results regarding classification criteria compared to existing deep learning and machine learning-based anomaly detection systems. The proposed method has reached 99.99\% and 99.85\% accuracy by identifying 27\% and 44\% of the effective features on the {TON}-{IoT} and {NSL}-{KDD} datasets, respectively.},

	abstract = {There is a significant recent interest in collaboratively training a machine learning ({ML}) model without collecting data to a central server. Federated learning ({FL}) emerges as an efficient solution mitigating systemic privacy risks and communication costs. However, conventional {FL} inherited from parameter server designs relies too much on a central server, which may lead to privacy risks, communication bottlenecks, or a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous and hierarchical local gradient aggregation and global model update algorithm, {FedDual}, under three different security considerations for {FL} in large decentralized networks. Particularly, {FedDual} preserves privacy by introducing local differential privacy ({LDP}) and aggregates local gradients asynchronously and hierarchically via a pair-wise gossip algorithm, which is more competitive than previous gossip-based decentralized {FL} methods in terms of privacy preservation and communication efficiency, and offers more computational efficiency compared to existing blockchain-assisted decentralized {FL} methods. Further, we devise a noise cutting trick based on Private Set Intersection ({PSI}) to mitigate the prediction performance loss of the global model caused by the leveraged {LDP}. Rigorous analyses show that {FedDual} helps decentralized {FL} achieve the same convergence rate of \${\textbackslash}mathcal O{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}frac 1T{\textbackslash}right) \$ as centralized {ML} theoretically. Ingenious experiments on {MNIST}, {CIFAR}-10, and {FEMNIST} confirm that the model prediction performance gained from {FedDual} is close to centralized {ML}. More importantly, the proposed noise cutting trick helps {FedDual} to train better global models than {LDP}-based {FL} methods in terms of prediction performance and convergence rate.},

	title = {{FedSEA}: A Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning Framework for Extremely Heterogeneous Devices},
	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) has attracted increasing attention as a promising technique to drive a vast number of edge devices with artificial intelligence. However, it is very challenging to guarantee the efficiency of a {FL} system in practice due to the heterogeneous computation resources on different devices. To improve the efficiency of {FL} systems in the real world, asynchronous {FL} ({AFL}) and semiasynchronous {FL} ({SAFL}) methods are proposed such that the server does not need to wait for stragglers. However, existing {AFL} and {SAFL} systems suffer from poor accuracy and low efficiency in realistic settings where the data is non-{IID} distributed across devices and the on-device resources are extremely heterogeneous. In this work, we propose {FedSEA} – a semi-asynchronous {FL} framework for extremely heterogeneous devices. We theoretically disclose that the unbalanced aggregation frequency is a root cause of accuracy drop in {SAFL}. Based on this analysis, we design a training configuration scheduler to balance the aggregation frequency of devices such that the accuracy can be improved. To improve the efficiency of the system in realistic settings where the devices have dynamic on-device resource availability, we design a scheduler that can efficiently predict the arriving time of local updates from devices and adjust the synchronization time point according to the devices’ predicted arriving time. We also consider the extremely heterogeneous settings where there exist extremely lagging devices that take hundreds of times as long as the training time of the other devices. In the real world, there might be even some extreme stragglers which are not capable of training the global model. To enable these devices to join in training without impairing the systematic efficiency, {FedSEA} enables these extreme stragglers to conduct local training on much smaller models. Our experiments show that compared with status quo approaches, {FedSEA} improves the inference accuracy by 44.34\% and reduces the systematic time cost and local training time cost by 87.02× and 792.9×. {FedSEA} also reduces the energy consumption of the devices with extremely limited resources by 752.9×.},

These clients cooperatively train a global, e.g., cloud-hosted, model without disclosing their local, private training data. The global model is then shared among all the participants which use it for local predictions. This paper proves that {FL} systems can be turned into covert channels to implement a stealth communication infrastructure. The main intuition is that, during federated training, a malicious sender can poison the global model by submitting purposely crafted examples. Although the effect of the model poisoning is negligible to other participants and does not alter the overall model performance, it can be observed by a malicious receiver and used to transmit a sequence of bits. We mounted our attack on an {FL} system to verify its feasibility. Experimental evidence shows that this covert channel is reliable, efficient, and extremely hard to counter. These results highlight that our new attacker model threatens {FL} infrastructures.},

	abstract = {Technological breakthroughs in the Internet of Things ({IoT}) easily promote smart lives for humans by connecting everything through the Internet. The de facto standardised {IoT} routing strategy is the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks ({RPL}), which is applied in various heterogeneous {IoT} applications. Hence, the increase in reliance on the {IoT} requires focus on the security of the {RPL} protocol. The top defence layer is an intrusion detection system ({IDS}), and the heterogeneous characteristics of the {IoT} and variety of novel intrusions make the design of the {RPL} {IDS} significantly complex. Most existing {IDS} solutions are unified models and cannot detect novel {RPL} intrusions. Therefore, the {RPL} requires a customised global attack knowledge-based {IDS} model to identify both existing and novel intrusions in order to enhance its security. Federated transfer learning ({FTL}) is a trending topic that paves the way to designing a customised {RPL}-{IoT} {IDS} security model in a heterogeneous {IoT} environment. In this paper, we propose a federated-transfer-learning-assisted customised distributed {IDS} ({FT}-{CID}) model to detect {RPL} intrusion in a heterogeneous {IoT}. The design process of {FT}-{CID} includes three steps: dataset collection, {FTL}-assisted edge {IDS} learning, and intrusion detection. Initially, the central server initialises the {FT}-{CID} with a predefined learning model and observes the unique features of different {RPL}-{IoTs} to construct a local model. The experimental model generates an {RPL}-{IIoT} dataset with normal and abnormal traffic through simulation on the Contiki-{NG} {OS}. Secondly, the edge {IDSs} are trained using the local parameters and the globally shared parameters generated by the central server through federation and aggregation of different local parameters of various edges. Hence, transfer learning is exploited to update the server’s and edges’ local and global parameters based on relational knowledge. It also builds and customised {IDS} model with partial retraining through local learning based on globally shared server knowledge. Finally, the customised {IDS} in the {FT}-{CID} model enforces the detection of intrusions in heterogeneous {IoT} networks. Moreover, the {FT}-{CID} model accomplishes high {RPL} security by implicitly utilising the local and global parameters of different {IoTs} with the assistance of {FTL}. The {FT}-{CID} detects {RPL} intrusions with an accuracy of 85.52\% in tests on a heterogeneous {IoT} network.},

	abstract = {The open, interconnected, and shared operational characteristics of the energy Internet introduce more sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. How to accurately detect these cyber attacks is crucial for energy Internet security protection. Existing machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms cannot cope with the continuous increase of network traffic and features in the energy Internet. And convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) can be a good solution for the descending and optimal selection of high-dimensional intrusion features. Unfortunately, traditional convolutional neural networks have complex structures with many parameters and are prone to fall into local optimality. To fill the gap of {CNN}, in this paper, we use a gene expression programming ({GEP}) to optimize the parameters of {CNN} and propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on {GEP}-{CNN} ({GCNN}-{IDS}). Our key idea is to avoid the convolutional neural network from falling into local optimum by designing a new code on {GEP} and fitness function to optimize the parameters of the {CNN} using the global search capability of {GEP}. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets and a real dataset substantiate that the detection accuracy of the optimized {CNN}-based intrusion detection algorithm ({ICNN}-{IDS}) reaches up to 0.9143 under different parameter combinations; meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, the detection accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and false detection rate of the intrusion detection model proposed in this paper reach 0.9897, 0.99, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.0126, respectively.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is an emerging technology that allows participants to jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their private data with others. However, {FL} is vulnerable to poisoning attacks such as backdoor attacks. Consequently, a variety of defenses have recently been proposed, which have primarily utilized intermediary states of the global model (i.e., logits) or distance of the local models (i.e., L2\&\#x2212;norm) with respect to the global model to detect malicious backdoors in {FL}. However, as these approaches directly operate on client updates (or weights), their effectiveness depends on factors such as clients\&\#x2019; data distribution or the adversary\&\#x2019;s attack strategies. In this paper, we introduce a novel and more generic backdoor defense framework, called {BayBFed}, which proposes to utilize probability distributions over client updates to detect malicious updates in {FL}: {BayBFed} computes a probabilistic measure over the clients\&\#x2019; updates to keep track of any adjustments made in the updates, and uses a novel detection algorithm that can leverage this probabilistic measure to efficiently detect and filter out malicious updates. Thus, it overcomes the shortcomings of previous approaches that arise due to the direct usage of client updates; nevertheless, our probabilistic measure will include all aspects of the local client training strategies. {BayBFed} utilizes two Bayesian Non-Parametric ({BNP}) extensions: (i) a Hierarchical Beta-Bernoulli process to draw a probabilistic measure given the clients\&\#x2019; updates, and (ii) an adaptation of the Chinese Restaurant Process ({CRP}), referred by us as {CRP}-Jensen, which leverages this probabilistic measure to detect and filter out malicious updates. We extensively evaluate our defense approach on five benchmark datasets: {CIFAR}10, Reddit, {IoT} intrusion detection, {MNIST}, and {FMNIST}, and show that it can effectively detect and eliminate malicious updates in {FL} without deteriorating the benign performance of the global model.},

This federated strategy decreases resource use without sacrificing security. Blockchain technology records and shares training models, assuring network security. Using real-time data sets, the suggested algorithm's performance under different attack scenarios were extensively tested.

	title = {Edge Computing-enabled Intrusion Detection for C-V2X Networks using Federated Learning},
	abstract = {Intrusion detection systems ({IDS}) have already demonstrated their effectiveness in detecting various attacks in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks, especially when using machine learning ({ML}) techniques. However, it has been shown that generating {ML}-based models in a centralized way consumes a massive quantity of network resources, such as {CPU}/memory and bandwidth, which may represent a critical issue in such networks. To avoid this problem, the new concept of Federated Learning ({FL}) emerged to build {ML}-based models in a distributed and collaborative way. In such an approach, the set of nodes, e.g., vehicles or {gNodeB}, collaborate to create a global {ML} model trained across these multiple decentralized nodes, each one with its respective data samples that are not shared with any other nodes. In this way, {FL} enables, on the one hand, data privacy since sharing data with a central location is not always feasible and, on the other hand, network overhead reduction. This paper designs a new {IDS} for C-V2X networks based on {FL}. It leverages edge computing to not only build a prediction model in a distributed way but also to enable lowlatency intrusion detection. Moreover, we build our {FL}-based {IDS} on top of the well-known {CIC}-{IDS}2018 dataset, which includes the main network attacks. Noting that, we first perform feature engineering on the dataset using the {ANOVA} method to consider only the most informative features. Simulation results show the efficiency of our system compared to the existing solutions in terms of attack detection accuracy while reducing network resource consumption.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning ({FL}) is a feasible technology to collaboratively train a model without sharing private data. This approach differs from traditional machine learning techniques, which aggregate local datasets in a single server. Thus, {FL} is adopted in the Healthcare sector to preserve the privacy of collected sensitive medical data from heterogenous and resource-constrained Internet of Medical Things ({IoMT}). However, {FL} requires aggregating all trained local models in a central server that presents a single point of failure. To address this issue, we propose a novel Blockchain-based Federated Learning architecture, which is applied to detect malicious network traffic in {IoMT} environments. In this paper, the proposed architecture takes advantage of a Hyperledger Fabric channel coupled with {FL} to manage efficiently and securely the learning process of an Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}). The Blockchain channel replaces the commonly used central server with the traditional {FL} approach. Moreover, the proposed approach benefits from the inherent features of Blockchain and {FL}. Besides, it secures patient data collection from the {IoMT} by examining the network traffic for unauthorised behaviour or policy breaches.},

According to their actions to damage network functioning, cyberattack is a significant issue in communication systems. The privacy, authenticity, or accessibility of a resource may be compromised by unauthorized activity or attacks, which intrusion detection systems ({IDS}) can help identify. Researchers explore the findings of research articles on the past, present, and potential of intrusion detection systems on wireless networks. Statistical modelling and deep learning are used to analyses the findings of journals. Isolation forest are one of the strategies that can acquire accurate network measures and produce appropriate choices by raising the detection rate and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a decision tree-based method for detection of network intrusions with improved data quality. In order to improve the data quality and provide appropriate training, networking data pre-processing and attributes selection based on entropy are specifically carried out. A isolation forest classifier is then constructed for accurate intrusion detection. Experimental analysis of two datasets demonstrates the proposed model's ability to produce reliable results. Actually, using the {CICIDS}2017 and {NSL}-{KDD} datasets, our model's accuracy is 99.98\% and 99.82\%, respectively. When compared to existing models, the new approach has many benefits in terms of false alarm rate ({FAR}), detection rate ({DR}), and accuracy ({ACC}).},

A disadvantage of the {FL} paradigm is the requirement of many communication rounds before model convergence. As a result, there is a challenge for running on-device {FL} with resource-hungry algorithms such as Deep Neural Network ({DNN}), especially in the resource-constrained Internet of Things ({IoT}) environments for security monitoring. To address this issue, this paper proposes Resource Efficient Federated Deep Learning ({REFDL}) method. Our method exploits and optimizes Federated Averaging (Fed-Avg) {DNN} based technique to reduce computational resources consumption for {IoT} security monitoring. It utilizes pruning and simulated micro-batching in optimizing the Fed-Avg {DNN} for effective and efficient {IoT} attacks detection at distributed edge nodes. The performance was evaluated using various realistic {IoT} and non-{IoT} benchmark datasets on virtual and testbed environments build with {GB}-{BXBT}-2807 edge-computing-like devices. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage by 81\% in the simulated environment of virtual workers compared to its benchmark counterpart. In the realistic testbed scenario, it saves 6\% memory while reducing execution time by 15\% without degrading accuracy.},

As a result of their susceptibility to malware, effective methods have become necessary for identifying {IoT} malware. However, the low generalizability and the non-independently and identically distributed data (non-{IID}) still pose a major challenge to achieving this goal. In this work, a new federated malware detection paradigm, termed {FED}-{MAL}, is introduced to collaboratively train multiple distributed edge devices to detect malware. In {FED}-{MAL}, the malware binaries are transformed into image format to lessen the impact on non-{IID}, and then a compact convolutional model, named {AM}-{NET}, is proposed to learn the malware patterns as an image recognition task. The compact nature of {AM}-{NET} makes it an appropriate choice for deployment on resource-constrained {IoT} devices. Following, a refined edge-based adversarial training is given in {FED}-{MAL} to empower generalizability and resistibility by generating adversarial samples from various participating clients. Experimental evaluation on publicly available malware datasets shows that the {FED}-{MAL} is efficacious, reliable, expandable, generalizable, and communication efficient.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service ({DDoS}) attacks are expected to continue plaguing service availability in emerging networks which rely on distributed edge clouds to offer critical, latency-sensitive applications. However, edge servers increase the network attack surface, which is exacerbated with the massive number of connected Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices that can be weaponized to launch {DDoS} attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to detect {DDoS} attacks early, i.e., at the network edge. In this paper, we empower the network edge with intelligent {DDoS} detection by learning from similarities between different data and {DDoS} attacks available across the edge servers. To this end, we develop a novel Outlier Exposure ({OE})-enabled cross-silo Federated Learning framework, namely {FedOE}. {FedOE} enables distributed training of {OE}-based {ML} models using a limited number of labeled outliers (i.e., attack flows) experienced at edge servers. We propose a novel {OE}-based Autoencoder ({oAE}) that can better discriminate anomalies in comparison to the widely adopted traditional Autoencoder, using a tailored, {OE}-based loss function. We evaluate {oAE} in {FedOE} and demonstrate its ability to generalize to zero-day attacks, with just 50 labeled attack flows per edge server. The results show that {oAE} achieves a high F1-score for most {DDoS} attacks, outclassing its non-{OE} counterpart.},

This enables anomaly detectors to generalize and detect unseen anomalies. In extensive experiments on natural language processing and small- and large-scale vision tasks, we find that Outlier Exposure significantly improves detection performance. We also observe that cutting-edge generative models trained on {CIFAR}-10 may assign higher likelihoods to {SVHN} images than to {CIFAR}-10 images; we use {OE} to mitigate this issue.

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is an emerging machine learning paradigm, in which clients jointly learn a model with the help of a cloud server. A fundamental challenge of {FL} is that the clients are often heterogeneous, e.g., they have different computing powers, and thus the clients may send model updates to the server with substantially different delays. Asynchronous {FL} aims to address this challenge by enabling the server to update the model once any client’s model update reaches it without waiting for other clients’ model updates. However, like synchronous {FL}, asynchronous {FL} is also vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients manipulate the model via poisoning their local data and/or model updates sent to the server. Byzantine-robust {FL} aims to defend against poisoning attacks. In particular, Byzantine-robust {FL} can learn an accurate model even if some clients are malicious and have Byzantine behaviors. However, most existing studies on Byzantine-robust {FL} focused on synchronous {FL}, leaving asynchronous {FL} largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing {AFLGuard}, a Byzantine-robust asynchronous {FL} method. We show that, both theoretically and empirically, {AFLGuard} is robust against various existing and adaptive poisoning attacks (both untargeted and targeted). Moreover, {AFLGuard} outperforms existing Byzantine-robust asynchronous {FL} methods.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning ({ML}) techniques have been widely applied for network intrusion detection. However, existing {ML}-based network intrusion detection systems ({NIDSs}) suffer from fundamental limitations that hinder them from being deployed in the real world. They consider a narrow scope rather than real-world drift that involves dynamically distributed network packets and well-crafted {ML} attacks. Besides, they pose high runtime overhead and have low processing speed. In this paper, we solve the limitations and design {ENIDrift}, a fast and adaptive ensemble system for real-world network intrusion detection. {ENIDrift} employs {iP}2V, a novel incremental feature extraction method based on network packet fields, which adopts a simple three-layer neural network with relatively lightweight computation and achieves high efficiency. {ENIDrift} uses a stable sub-classifier generation module that constructs new sub-classifiers based on the stability and accuracy of incoming data chunks, and its training time is reduced from to . We extend the threat model and place experiments in real-world settings. We make the first real-world drift dataset, {RWDIDS}, which contains intense and different drifts for {NIDS}. Our extensive evaluation under real-world drift demonstrates that {ENIDrift} significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by up to 69.78\% of F1 and reduces running time by 87.6\%. {ENIDrift} achieves a 100\% F1 against our adversarial attack and is adaptive to various real-world drifts. Our field test also shows {ENIDrift} functions well even with delayed, inadequate training data, which is practical for real-world usage.},

However, the deviations of private datasets and the heterogeneity of local models caused by the difference in device composition and application scenarios have hampering the aggregation of global recognition model in modulation classification task, thus constraining the classification performance of intelligent {IoT}-edge devices severely. To address this problem, we propose a heterogenous Federated learning framework based on Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation ({FedBKD}) for {IoT} system, which integrates knowledge distillation into the local model upload (client-to-cloud) and global model download (cloud-to-client) steps of federated learning. The client-to-cloud distillation is regarded as a process of multi-teacher knowledge distillation and the global network is regarded as a student network that unifies the heterogeneous knowledge from multiple local teacher networks. A public dataset is generated by conditional variational autoencoder ({CVAE}) and stored in the cloud server for supporting the obtaining of heterogeneous knowledge without sharing the private data of {IoT} devices. The cloud-to-client distillation is single-teacher-multiple-students process, which distills the knowledge from the single global model back to multiple heterogeneous local networks and partial knowledge distillation is used in this process. We implement our {FedBKD} method in the modulation classification task and the simulation results have proven the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

However, blockchain alone cannot ascertain the authenticity and veracity of the data coming from {IoT} devices.

The accuracy, precision, and recall were calculated and compared using {NSL}-{KDD} training and validation data, which is widely used in intrusion detection to compare the detection effects of the two techniques. {DNN} shows slightly higher accuracy than the {SVM} model. The risk of recognizing an actual intrusion as normal data is much greater than the risk of considering normal data as an intrusion, so {DNN} proves to be much more effective in intrusion detection than {SVM}.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}), as a popular distributed machine learning paradigm, has driven the integration of knowledge in ubiquitous data owners under one roof. Although designed for privacy-preservation by nature, the supposed well-sanitized parameters still convey sensitive information (e.g., reconstruction attack), while existing technical countermeasures provide weak explainability for privacy understanding and protection practices of general users. This work investigates these privacy concerns with an exploratory study and elaborates on data owners’ expectations in {FL}. Based on the analysis, we design the first interactive visualization system for {FL} privacy that supports intelligible privacy inspection and adjustment for data owners. Specifically, our proposal facilitates sample recommendation for joint privacy–performance training at cold start. Then it provides visual interpretation and attention rendering of privacy risks in view of multiple attacking channels and a holistic view. Further it supports interactive privacy enhancement involving both user initiative and differential privacy technique, and iterative trade-off with real-time inference accuracy estimation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the system and collect qualitative feedbacks from users. The results demonstrate that 96.7\% of users acknowledge the benefits to privacy inspection and adjustment and 90.3\% are willing to use our system. More importantly, 87.1\% increase the willingness of contributing data for {FL}.},

However, the introduction of {IIoT} devices opens up the door for a variety of cyber threats in smart industries. The detection of cyber threats against such extensive, complex, and heterogeneous smart manufacturing industries is very challenging due to the lack of sufﬁcient attack traces. Therefore, in this work, a Federated Learning enabled Deep Intrusion Detection framework is proposed to detect cyber threats in smart manufacturing industries. The proposed {FLDID} framework allows multiple smart manufacturing industries to build a collaborative model to detect threats and overcome the limited attack example problem with individual industries. Moreover, to ensure the privacy of model gradients, Paillier-based encryption is used in communication between edge devices (representative of smart industries) and the server. The deep learning-based hybrid model, which consists of a Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory, and Multi-Layer Perceptron is used in the intrusion detection model. An exhaustive set of experiments on the publically available dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed framework for detecting cyber threats in smart industries over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Besides coming with unprecedented benefits, the Internet of Things ({IoT}) suffers deficits in security measures, leading to attacks increasing every year. In particular, network environments such as smart homes lack managed security capabilities to detect {IoT}-related attacks; {IoT} devices hosted therein are thus more easily infiltrated by threats. As such, context awareness on {IoT} infections is hard to achieve, preventing prompt response. In this work, we propose {MUDscope}, an approach to monitor malicious network activities affecting {IoT} in real-world consumer environments. We leverage the recent Manufacturer Usage Description ({MUD}) specification, which defines networking whitelists for {IoT} devices in {MUD} profiles, to reflect consistent and necessarily-anomalous activities from smart things. Our approach characterizes this traffic and extracts signatures for given attacks. By analyzing attack signatures for multiple devices, we gather insights into emerging attack patterns. We evaluate our approach on both an existing dataset, and a new openly available dataset created for this research. We show that {MUDscope} detects several attacks targeting {IoT} devices with an F1-score of 95.77\% and correctly identifies signatures for specific attacks with an F1-score of 87.72\%.},

	abstract = {The uses of Machine Learning ({ML}) in detection of network attacks have been effective when designed and evaluated in a single organisation. However, it has been very challenging to design an {ML}-based detection system by utilising heterogeneous network data samples originating from several sources. This is mainly due to privacy concerns and the lack of a universal format of datasets. In this paper, we propose a collaborative federated learning scheme to address these issues. The proposed framework allows multiple organisations to join forces in the design, training, and evaluation of a robust {ML}-based network intrusion detection system. The threat intelligence scheme utilises two critical aspects for its application; the availability of network data traffic in a common format to allow for the extraction of meaningful patterns across data sources. Secondly, the adoption of a federated learning mechanism to avoid the necessity of sharing sensitive users' information between organisations. As a result, each organisation benefits from other organisations cyber threat intelligence while maintaining the privacy of its data internally. The model is trained locally and only the updated weights are shared with the remaining participants in the federated averaging process. The framework has been designed and evaluated in this paper by using two key datasets in a {NetFlow} format known as {NF}-{UNSW}-{NB}15-v2 and {NF}-{BoT}-{IoT}-v2. Two other common scenarios are considered in the evaluation process; a centralised training method where the local data samples are shared with other organisations and a localised training method where no threat intelligence is shared. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework by designing a universal {ML} model effectively classifying benign and intrusive traffic originating from multiple organisations without the need for local data exchange.},

The {PIDD} is composed of three modules: privacy-enhanced topology graphs generation module, graph convolutional networks-based user evaluation module, and the deep reinforcement learning-based intruder identification and handling module.

In these techniques, a classification model is trained by learning cyber behavior patterns. However, these models typically require considerable high-quality datasets. Limited attack samples are available because of the unpredictability and constant evolution of cyber threats. To address these problems, we propose a novel federated Execution\&Evaluation dual network framework ({EEFED}), which allows multiple federal participants to personalize their local detection models undermining the original purpose of Federated Learning. Thus, a general global detection model was developed for collaboratively improving the performance of a single local model against cyberattacks. The proposed personalized update algorithm and the optimizing backtracking parameters replacement policy effectively reduced the negative influence of federated learning in imbalanced and non-i.i.d distribution of data. The proposed method improved model stability. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on a network dataset in various cyber scenarios revealed that the proposed method outperformed single model and state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {The individual and integration use of the Internet of Things ({IoT}), Information-Centric Networking ({ICN}), and Federated Learning ({FL}) have recently been used in several network-related scenarios and have consequently experienced a growing interest in the research community. Federated learning addresses the privacy and security issues of the {IoT} data in a decentralized manner. Also, it can be capable of training the multiple learning algorithms through local content except for exchanging data through intelligent Artificial Intelligence ({AI})-based algorithms. Moreover, in {ICN}, the content is retrieved and stored based on the content name rather than the content location address. On the other hand, it is challenging to support the massive {IoT} devices by the fifth generation (5G) mobile-cellular networks. Therefore, the cellular 6G networks are expected to increase the connection capabilities by 10–100 times over 5G, which necessitates a convergence of Communication, Computing, and Caching (3C). At the same time, the in-network caching capabilities of {ICN} can be attractive features for {IoT} networks. {IoT} aspires to link anybody and/or everything at any time and location. However, integrating {IoT} with different areas is a new academic topic and is still in its infancy. As a result, this research highlights the potential of {ICN} for {IoTs} by conducting an exhaustive literature review. This work provides a comprehensive survey regarding these three recent research trends (i.e., {FL}, {IoT}, and {ICN}) and reviews the related state-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each technology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we envision the integration of such technologies to take advantage efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise ({FL}-{ICN}-{IoT}) utilization based on the need for more robust security and privacy. Additionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both individually and combinedly. Finally, we discuss the open issues of the reviewed research and describe potential directions for future avenues regarding integrating {IoT}, {ICN}, and {FL} technologies.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is proving to be one of the most promising paradigms for leveraging distributed resources, enabling a set of clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model while keeping the data decentralized. The explosive growth of interest in the topic has led to rapid advancements in several core aspects like communication efficiency, handling non-{IID} data, privacy, and security capabilities. However, the majority of {FL} works only deal with supervised tasks, assuming that clients' training sets are labeled. To leverage the enormous unlabeled data on distributed edge devices, in this paper, we aim to extend the {FL} paradigm to unsupervised tasks by addressing the problem of anomaly detection in decentralized settings. In particular, we propose a novel method in which, through a preprocessing phase, clients are grouped into communities, each having similar majority (i.e., inlier) patterns. Subsequently, each community of clients trains the same anomaly detection model (i.e., autoencoders) in a federated fashion. The resulting model is then shared and used to detect anomalies within the clients of the same community that joined the corresponding federated process. Experiments show that our method is robust, and it can detect communities consistent with the ideal partitioning in which groups of clients having the same inlier patterns are known. Furthermore, the performance is significantly better than those in which clients train models exclusively on local data and comparable with federated models of ideal communities' partition.},

By pushing {AI} at the network edge, close to the large amount of raw input data, the traﬃc traversing the core network as well as the inference latency can be reduced. Despite such neat beneﬁts, the actual deployment of edge {AI} across distributed nodes raises novel challenges to be addressed, such as the need to enforce proper addressing and discovery procedures, to identify {AI} components, and to chain them in an interoperable manner. Named Data Networking ({NDN}) has been recently argued as one of the main enablers of network and computing convergence, which edge {AI} should build upon. However, the peculiarities of such a new paradigm entails to go a step further. In this paper we disclose the potential of {NDN} to support the orchestration of edge {AI}.

Forwarding optimization and routing policies become thereafter a basis of dynamic decisions for (re)-distributing computations, and retrieving results. In this paper we describe the intrinsic operations and mechanisms of an instantiation of {NFN} based on untyped Lambda expressions and Scala procedures.

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is gaining momentum as a prominent solution to perform training procedures without the need to move sensitive end-user data to a centralized third party server. In {FL}, models are locally trained at distributed end-devices, acting as clients, and only model updates are transferred from the clients to the aggregator, which is in charge of global model aggregation. Although {FL} can ensure better privacy preservation than centralized machine learning ({ML}), it exhibits still some concerns. First, clients need to be properly discovered and selected to ensure that highly accurate models are built. Second, huge models may still require to be exchanged from the aggregator to all the selected clients, incurring a not negligible network footprint. To tackle such issues, in this paper, we propose a framework built upon in-network caching, multicast and name based data delivery, natively provided by the Named Data Networking ({NDN}) paradigm, in order to support client discovery and aggregator-clients data exchange. Benefits of the proposal are showcased when compared to a conventional application-layer solution.},

	abstract = {In the current era of the Internet of Vehicles ({IoV}), vehicle to vehicle data sharing can provide customized applications for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles ({CAVs}). The advancement of Deep Learning ({DL}) methodologies is one of the key driving forces for {CAVs}, allowing elaborating a massive amount of data by the resource-constrained onboard devices. In a traditional centralized {DL} approach, vehicle data are transmitted to the cloud for the training of models. This approach leads to significant communication overhead, high delays, and data privacy concerns. Conversely, Federated Learning ({FL}) performs the training using the local models in a distributed fashion and mitigates the data privacy risks by sharing only the model parameters with the server, optimizing the {FL} to be used with resources-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose the design of a scalable communication infrastructure to support the {FL} procedure based on Information-Centric Networking ({ICN}) using Apache Kafka, called {KafkaFed}. The {ICN}-based infrastructure allows to overcome the shortcomings of current client-server architectures for {FL}, in which routing is content-based or name-based to achieve efficient data retrieval for mobile nodes. In {ICN}, data are stored at intermediate nodes to provide efficient and reliable data delivery. A proof of concept of the {KafkaFed} communication architecture is developed and tested in an emulated environment. The performance of the proposed framework compared to the client server-based {FL} architecture, i.e., {FLOWER} showed a boost of almost 40\% with just 32 clients in addition to several other advantages of scalability, reliability, and security},

	abstract = {The simultaneous development of deep learning techniques and Internet of Things ({IoT})/Cyber-physical Systems ({CPS}) technologies has afforded untold possibilities for improving distributed computing, sensing, and data analysis. Among these technologies, federated learning has received increased attention as a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm, and has shown significant potential in {IoT}/{CPS}-driven large-scale smart-world systems. At the same time, the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks, especially to adversarial attacks, cannot be overstated and should not be minimized. Moreover, the distributed nature of federated learning makes defense against such adversarial attacks a more challenging problem due to the unavailability of local data and resource heterogeneity. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose {ZeKoC}, a Zero Knowledge Clustering approach to mitigating adversarial attacks. Particularly, we first formulate the problem of resource-constrained adversarial mitigation. Specifically, noting that a global server has no access to training samples, we reformulate the unsupervised weight clustering problem. Our proposed {ZeKoC} approach allows the server to automatically split and merge weight clusters for weight selection and aggregation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that convergence is guaranteed. Further, our experimental results illustrate that, in a non-i.i.d. (i.e., independent and identically distributed) data setting, the proposed {ZeKoC} approach successfully mitigates general attacks while outperforming state-of-art schemes.},

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence ({CTI}) sharing is an important activity to reduce information asymmetries between attackers and defenders. However, this activity presents challenges due to the tension between data sharing and conﬁdentiality, that result in information retention often leading to a free-rider problem. Therefore, the information that is shared represents only the tip of the iceberg. Current literature assumes access to centralized databases containing all the information, but this is not always feasible, due to the aforementioned tension. This results in unbalanced or incomplete datasets, requiring the use of techniques to expand them; we show how these techniques lead to biased results and misleading performance expectations. We propose a novel framework for extracting {CTI} from distributed data on incidents, vulnerabilities and indicators of compromise, and demonstrate its use in several practical scenarios, in conjunction with the Malware Information Sharing Platforms ({MISP}). Policy implications for {CTI} sharing are presented and discussed. The proposed system relies on an eﬃcient combination of privacy enhancing technologies and federated processing. This lets organizations stay in control of their {CTI} and minimize the risks of exposure or leakage, while enabling the beneﬁts of sharing, more accurate and representative results, and more eﬀective predictive and preventive defenses.},

	abstract = {The constantly evolving digital transformation imposes new requirements on our society. Aspects relating to reliance on the networking domain and the difficulty of achieving security by design pose a challenge today. As a result, data-centric and machine-learning approaches arose as feasible solutions for securing large networks. Although, in the network security domain, {ML}-based solutions face a challenge regarding the capability to generalize between different contexts. In other words, solutions based on specific network data usually do not perform satisfactorily on other networks. This paper describes the stacked-unsupervised federated learning ({FL}) approach to generalize on a cross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system ({NIDS}). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in conjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. Our approach performs better than traditional local learning and naive cross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data). Remarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case of non-iid data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an ensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed {FL}-based {NIDS} results in a feasible approach for generalization between heterogeneous networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first successful approach to applying unsupervised {FL} on the problem of network intrusion detection generalization using flow-based data.},

	abstract = {Virtualized network slicing allows a multitude of logical networks to be created on a common substrate infrastructure to support diverse services. A virtualized network slice is a logical combination of multiple virtual network functions, which run on virtual machines ({VMs}) as software applications by virtualization techniques. As the performance of network slices hinges on the normal running of {VMs}, detecting and analyzing anomalies in {VMs} are critical. Based on the three-tier management framework of virtualized network slicing, we ﬁrst develop a federated learning ({FL}) based three-tier distributed {VM} anomaly detection framework, which enables distributed network slice managers to collaboratively train a global {VM} anomaly detection model while keeping metrics data locally. The high-dimensional, imbalanced, and distributed data features in virtualized network slicing scenarios invalidate the existing anomaly detection models. Considering the powerful ability of generative adversarial network ({GAN}) in capturing the distribution from complex data, we design a new multi-discriminator Bidirectional Wasserstein {GAN} with Gradient Penalty ({BiWGAN}-{GP}) model to learn the normal data distribution from high-dimensional resource metrics datasets that are spread on multiple {VM} monitors. The multi-discriminator {BiWGAN}-{GP} model can be trained over distributed data sources, which avoids high communication and computation overhead caused by the centralized collection and processing of local data. We deﬁne an anomaly score as the discriminant criterion to quantify the deviation of new metrics data from the learned normal distribution to detect abnormal behaviors arising in {VMs}. The efﬁciency and effectiveness of the proposed collaborative anomaly detection algorithm are validated through extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset.},

However, the augmentation of legacy {ICS} networks with smart computing and networking technologies (such as, {IoT}) have intensely enlarged the surface of attacks against these critical infrastructures. This augmentation makes these networks more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and despite the current security solutions, attackers still find ways to proliferate these networks. Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) is one of the key security aspect to prevent these networks from contemporary cyber-attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a new {IDS} model named Federated-{SRUs} (simple recurrent units) for the security of {IoT}-based {ICSs}. Specifically, the Federated-{SRUs} {IDS} model uses an improved simple recurrent units architecture to reduce computational cost and alleviate the gradient vanishing issue in recurrent networks. Then, it performs data aggregation through several communication rounds in federated architecture which allows multiple {ICS} networks and stakeholders to build a comprehensive {IDS} model in a privacy-preserving manner. The performance of Federated-{SRUs} {IDS} model is validated through experiments using real-world gas pipeline-based {ICS} network data, which indicates that it is able to accurately detect intrusions in real-time without compromising privacy and security. Experiments also verify that the Federated-{SRUs} model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and thus can serve as a viable {IDS} method in {IoT}-based {ICS} networks.},

Based on the feature extraction ability of {LSTM} networks, the generated data with {CGAN} are used as augmented data and applied in the detection and classification of intrusion data. Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of {CGAN} models using multiple distributed datasets. Blockchain stores and shares the training models to ensure security when the global model’s aggregation and updating. The proposed method has good generalization ability, which can greatly improve the detection of intrusion data.},

Prior work identiﬁed a range of security threats on federated learning protocols that poison the data or the model. However, federated learning is a networked system where the communication between clients and server plays a critical role for the learning task performance. We highlight how communication introduces another vulnerability surface in federated learning and study the impact of network-level adversaries on training federated learning models. We show that attackers dropping the network trafﬁc from carefully selected clients can signiﬁcantly decrease model accuracy on a target population. Moreover, we show that a coordinated poisoning campaign from a few clients can amplify the dropping attacks. Finally, we develop a server-side defense which mitigates the impact of our attacks by identifying and up-sampling clients likely to positively contribute towards target accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate our attacks and defenses on three datasets, assuming encrypted communication channels and attackers with partial visibility of the network.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is an emerging distributed machine learning technique. However, when dealing with heterogeneous data, a shared global model cannot generalise all devices’ local data. Furthermore, the {FL} training process necessitates frequent parameter communication, which interferes with the limited bandwidth and unstable connections of participating devices. These two issues have a significant impact on {FL}’s effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, an enhanced communication-efficient personalised {FL} technique, {FedGB}, is proposed. Different from existing approaches, {FedGB} believes that only interacting common information from training results on different devices can improve local personalised training results more effectively. {FedGB} dynamically selects the backbone structures in the local models to represent the dynamically determined backbone information (common features) in the global model for aggregation. Only interacting common features between different nodes reduce the impact of heterogeneous data to a certain extent. The dynamic adaptive sub-model selection avoids the impact of manually setting the scale of sub-model. {FedGB} can thus reduce communication overheads while maintaining inference accuracy. The results obtained in a variety of experimental settings show that {FedGB} can effectively improve communication efficiency and inference accuracy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07194},
	abstract = {Machine Learning ({ML}) is a distributed approach for training predictive models on the Internet of Vehicles ({IoV}) to enable smart public transportation. Since the trafﬁc conditions change over time, the {ML} model that predicts trafﬁc ﬂows and the time passengers wait at stops must be updated continuously and efﬁciently. Federated learning ({FL}) is a distributed machine learning scheme that allows vehicles to receive continuous model updates without having to upload raw data to the cloud and wait for models to be trained. However, {FL} in smart public transportation is vulnerable to poisoning or {DDoS} attacks since vehicles travel in public. Besides, due to device heterogeneity and imbalanced data distributions, the synchronized aggregation strategy that collects local models from speciﬁc vehicles before aggregation is inefﬁcient. Although Asynchronous Federated Learning ({AFL}) schemes are developed to improve efﬁciency by aggregating local models as soon as they are received, the stale local models remain unreasonably weighted, resulting in poor learning performance. To enable smarter public transportation, this paper offers a blockchainbased asynchronous federated learning scheme with a dynamic scaling factor ({DBAFL}). Speciﬁcally, the novel committee-based consensus algorithm for blockchain improves reliability at the lowest possible cost of time. Meanwhile, the devised dynamic scaling factor allows {AFL} to assign reasonable weight to stale local models. Extensive experiments conducted on heterogeneous devices validate outperformed learning performance, efﬁciency, and reliability of {DBAFL}.},

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence ({CTI}) is the knowledge of cyber and physical threats that help mitigate potential cyber attacks. The rapid evolution of the current threat landscape has seen many organisations share {CTI} to strengthen their security posture for mutual beneﬁt. However, in many cases, {CTI} data contains attributes (e.g., software versions) that have the potential to leak sensitive information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation. While current approaches allow restricting {CTI} sharing to trusted organisations, they lack solutions where the shared data can be veriﬁed and disseminated ‘differentially’ (i.e., selective information sharing) with policies and metrics ﬂexibly deﬁned by an organisation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based {CTI} sharing framework that allows organisations to share sensitive {CTI} data in a trusted, veriﬁable and differential manner. We discuss the limitations associated with existing approaches and highlight the advantages of the proposed {CTI} sharing framework. We further present a detailed proof of concept using the Ethereum blockchain network. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework can facilitate the exchange of {CTI} without creating signiﬁcant additional overheads.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients corrupt the global model via sending manipulated model updates to the server. Existing defenses mainly rely on Byzantine-robust or provably robust {FL} methods, which aim to learn an accurate global model even if some clients are malicious. However, they can only resist a small number of malicious clients. It is still an open challenge how to defend against model poisoning attacks with a large number of malicious clients. Our {FLDetector} addresses this challenge via detecting malicious clients. {FLDetector} aims to detect and remove majority of the malicious clients such that a Byzantine-robust or provably robust {FL} method can learn an accurate global model using the remaining clients. Our key observation is that, in model poisoning attacks, the model updates from a client in multiple iterations are inconsistent. Therefore, {FLDetector} detects malicious clients via checking their model-updates consistency. Roughly speaking, the server predicts a client’s model update in each iteration based on historical model updates, and flags a client as malicious if the received model update from the client and the predicted model update are inconsistent in multiple iterations. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that {FLDetector} can accurately detect malicious clients in multiple stateof-the-art model poisoning attacks and adaptive attacks tailored to {FLDetector}. After removing the detected malicious clients, existing Byzantine-robust {FL} methods can learn accurate global models. Our code is available at https://github.com/zaixizhang/{FLDetector}.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}) has recently attracted increasing attention from academia and industry, with the ultimate goal of achieving collaborative training under privacy and communication constraints. Existing iterative model averaging based {FL} algorithms require a large number of communication rounds to obtain a wellperformed model due to extremely unbalanced and non-i.i.d data partitioning among different clients. Thus, we propose {FedDM} to build the global training objective from multiple local surrogate functions, which enables the server to gain a more global view of the loss landscape. In detail, we construct synthetic sets of data on each client to locally match the loss landscape from original data through distribution matching. {FedDM} reduces communication rounds and improves model quality by transmitting more informative and smaller synthesized data compared with unwieldy model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on three image classiﬁcation datasets, and results show that our method can outperform other {FL} counterparts in terms of efﬁciency and model performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that {FedDM} can be adapted to preserve differential privacy with Gaussian mechanism and train a better model under the same privacy budget.},

In this paper, we formalize and address the problem of compressing client-to-server model updates under the Secure Aggregation primitive, a core component of Federated Learning pipelines that allows the server to aggregate the client updates without accessing them individually. In particular, we adapt standard scalar quantization and pruning methods to Secure Aggregation and propose Secure Indexing, a variant of Secure Aggregation that supports quantization for extreme compression.

	abstract = {In many applications, multiple parties have private data regarding the same set of users but on disjoint sets of attributes, and a server wants to leverage the data to train a model. To enable model learning while protecting the privacy of the data subjects, we need vertical federated learning ({VFL}) techniques, where the data parties share only information for training the model, instead of the private data. However, it is challenging to ensure that the shared information maintains privacy while learning accurate models. To the best of our knowledge, the algorithm proposed in this paper is the first practical solution for differentially private vertical federated 𝑘-means clustering, where the server can obtain a set of global centers with a provable differential privacy guarantee. Our algorithm assumes an untrusted central server that aggregates differentially private local centers and membership encodings from local data parties. It builds a weighted grid as the synopsis of the global dataset based on the received information. Final centers are generated by running any 𝑘-means algorithm on the weighted grid. Our approach for grid weight estimation uses a novel, light-weight, and differentially private set intersection cardinality estimation algorithm based on the Flajolet-Martin sketch. To improve the estimation accuracy in the setting with more than two data parties, we further propose a refined version of the weights estimation algorithm and a parameter tuning strategy to reduce the final 𝑘-means utility to be close to that in the central private setting. We provide theoretical utility analysis and experimental evaluation results for the cluster centers computed by our algorithm and show that our approach performs better both theoretically and empirically than the two baselines based on existing techniques.},
