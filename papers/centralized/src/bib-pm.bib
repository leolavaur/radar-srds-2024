	abstract = {Regardless of the context to which it is applied, sharing resources is well-recognized for its considerable benefits. Since 5G networks will be service-oriented, on-demand, and highly heterogeneous, it is utmost important to approach the design and optimization of the network from an end-to-end perspective. In addition, in order to ensure end-to-end performance, this approach has to entail both wireless and optical domains, altogether with the IoT, edge, and cloud paradigms which are an indispensable part of the 5G network architecture. Shifting from the exclusive ownership of network resources toward sharing enables all participants to cope with stringent service requirements in 5G networks, gaining significant performance improvements and cost savings at the same time. The main objective of this paper is to survey the literature on resource sharing, providing an in-depth and comprehensive perspective of sharing by recognizing the main trends, the techniques which enable sharing, and the challenges that need to be addressed. By providing a taxonomy which brings the relevant features of a comprehensive sharing model into focus, we aim to enable the creation of sharing models for more efficient future communication networks. We also summarize and discuss the relevant issues arising from network sharing, that should be properly tackled in the future.},

In this context, transparent and trusted frameworks that enable network service providers and infrastructure providers to advertise, negotiate and acquire, in real time, 5G resources and services, distributed over various geographical areas, are extremely valuable. To address this goal, emerging Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) arise as well-suited solutions to ensure distributed security and trust, as well as effective and agile transaction management across the various parties involved in the 5G service chain implementation. Following this vision, this paper presents the design of a DLT-enabled Marketplace aimed to foster the secure trading of heterogeneous resources in dynamic 5G ecosystems. The performance of an initial implementation as proof-of-concept is also analyzed. The results of this proof-of-concept validate the feasibility of a decentralized marketplace implementation in the context of 5G resource trading.},

	abstract = {In the evolution from 5G to beyond 5G networks, new business models are emerging where multi-domain and multistakeholder scenarios will play a paramount role as enablers. In these scenarios, the automated management of the services with minimal human intervention, also known as zero-touch management, is a pivotal requirement to ensure a proper functioning and to enable real-time responses to possible incidents or scalability needs. Nonetheless, these new scenarios and requirements also introduce new security risks that entail a complex threat landscape for beyond 5G networks. Hence, zero-touch management demands new solutions capable of securely controlling network resources into end-to-end scenarios distributed in multiple domains. In this vein, several challenges arise and need to be addressed, such as integrity, non-repudiation, conﬁdentiality, security, and trust. Therefore, the H2020 5GZORRO project proposes new security and trust solutions for multi-domain and multi-stakeholder scenarios in 5G and beyond networks. To deal with the utmost importance security and trust challenges, we introduce different modules to mitigate them, namely, integrity and non-repudiation through Distributed Ledger Technologies, decentralized identity through an Identity and Permission Manager, end-to-end trustworthy relationships via a Trust Management Framework, secure workloads across different tenants and stakeholders via Trusted Execution Environment Security Management, detection and response to internal vulnerabilities and attacks via Network Monitoring, and on-demand secure cross-domain connections via VPN-as-a-Service. Therefore, the built security and trust 5GZORRO mechanisms form a secure environment with zero-touch automation capabilities, minimizing human intervention.},

In general, trust and reliability help vehicles to collect correct and credible information from surrounding vehicles. On top of that, a secure trust model can deal with uncertainties and risk taking from unreliable information in vehicular environments. However, inaccurate, incomplete, and imprecise information collected by vehicles as well as movable/immovable obstacles have interrupting effects on VANET. In this paper, a fuzzy trust model based on experience and plausibility is proposed to secure the vehicular network. The proposed trust model executes a series of security checks to ensure the correctness of the information received from authorized vehicles. Moreover, fog nodes are adopted as a facility to evaluate the level of accuracy of event's location. The analyses show that the proposed solution not only detects malicious attackers and faulty nodes, but also overcomes the uncertainty and imprecision of data in vehicular networks in both line of sight and non-line of sight environments.},

	abstract = {The problem of routing security in vehicular ad hoc networks has become a major concern for researchers. Compared with cryptography-based solutions, trust-based solutions are considered to be more acceptable as a promising approach, which mainly define two operations: trust computing and security application. In this paper we first study trust properties and construct a novel trust inference model, where two trust attributes named subjective trust and recommendation trust, are selected to quantify the trust level of a specific vehicle. The SCGM(1,1)-weighted Markov prediction algorithm based on fluctuation recognition is utilized to calculate the subjective trust accurately, meanwhile a new evaluation method of recommendation credibility based on the feedback mechanism is introduced for the calculation of recommendation trust. We subsequently exploit the advantages of mesh structure and design a light-weight trust-aware multicast routing protocol (i.e., LTMRP), which can establish secure and reliable communication paths by selecting trusted relay vehicles. To further improve the routing efficiency, two mechanisms including forwarding nodes reuse mechanism and trust-aware route handoff mechanism are proposed. Simulation verification and comparison of the relevant trust models and trust-based protocols are accomplished by three simulation platforms (i.e., Netlogo, SUMO, and NS-2).The convincing results show that our trust model obtains strong resistibility to multiple malicious attacks. Moreover, examined in four routing metrics, the experimental results indicate that LTMRP performs better than the other relevant protocols.},

Researchers have proposed many methods to use machine learning for trust evaluation. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive literature review on this topic. In this article, we perform a thorough survey on trust evaluation based on machine learning. First, we cover essential prerequisites of trust evaluation and machine learning. Then, we justify a number of requirements that a sound trust evaluation method should satisfy, and propose them as evaluation criteria to assess the performance of trust evaluation methods. Furthermore, we systematically organize existing methods according to application scenarios and provide a comprehensive literature review on trust evaluation from the perspective of machine learning’s function in trust evaluation and evaluation granularity. Finally, according to the completed review and evaluation, we explore some open research problems and suggest the directions that are worth our research effort in the future.},

Federated learning (FL) trains models over distributed devices and model parameters are shared instead of actual data in a privacy-preserving manner. Unfortunately, FL is also vulnerable to attacks including parameter/data poisoning attacks. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of the data poisoning attack on this training method with a label-flipping attack. We propose a poisoning attack mitigation technique based on the reputation of nodes' involved in the training process. The reputation score for each client is calculated using the beta probability distribution method. This is the first work to show the removal of malicious nodes with the poisoned dataset from the training environment based on the calculated reputation score. The improvement in model performance after filtering malicious nodes is validated using the benchmark MNIST dataset. At the same time, our work contributes to preventing denial of service attacks by considering a blockchain-based server network. Our results hold for two different attack settings with different proportions of poisoned data samples.},

To date there is little work on trust computation in IoT environments for service management, especially for dealing with misbehaving owners of IoT devices that provide services to other IoT devices in the system. Our approach is to classify existing trust computation models for service management in IoT systems based on five essential design dimensions for a trust computation model: trust composition, trust propagation, trust aggregation, trust update, and trust formation. We summarize pros and cons of each dimension's options, and highlight the effectiveness of defense mechanisms against malicious attacks. We also summarize the most, least, and little visited trust computation techniques in the literature and provide insight on the effectiveness of trust computation techniques as applying to IoT systems. Finally, we identify gaps in IoT trust computation research and suggest future research directions.},

However, designing a suitable placement scheme for multi-tenant SFCs to balance resource consumption with performance and security is a tricky issue. In this paper, we first proposed security constraints based on physical isolation and formulated the problem of reasonably placing multi-tenant SFCs subject to multiple constraints to minimize resource consumption. The proposed problem is more intractable than previous works because of the extra introduced security constraints. To solve it, a new non-uniform weighted hypergraph construction approach is proposed by defining hyperedge weights to represent the resource consumption on one SFC. A hypergraph matching algorithm is proposed to find the maximum weight subset of hypergraphs whose vertices do not intersect to give a high degree of physical isolation by dealing with the conflict graphs. Simulation results show that the proposed hypergraph matching algorithm outperforms the comparison schemes in terms of the resource consumption while satisfying the security requirements.},

In federated learning, training data is widely distributed and maintained on the mobile devices as workers. A central aggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile devices using their local training data to train the global model in each iteration. However, unreliable data may be uploaded by the mobile devices (i.e., workers), leading to frauds in tasks of federated learning. The workers may perform unreliable updates intentionally, for example, the data poisoning attack, or unintentionally, for example, low-quality data caused by energy constraints or high-speed mobility. Therefore, finding out trusted and reliable workers in federated learning tasks becomes critical. In this article, the concept of reputation is introduced as a metric. Based on this metric, a reliable worker selection scheme is proposed for federated learning tasks. Consortium blockchain is leveraged as a decentralized approach for achieving efficient reputation management of the workers without repudiation and tampering.

	abstract = {Amid growing concerns on data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. Given that the FL network is expected to be implemented at scale, several studies have proposed system architectures towards improving the network scalability and efficiency. Specifically, the Hierarchical FL (HFL) network utilizes cluster heads, e.g., base stations, for the intermediate aggregation and relay of model parameters. Serverless FL is also proposed recently, in which the data owners, i.e., workers, exchange the local model parameters among a neighborhood of workers. This decentralized approach reduces the risk of a single point of failure but inevitably incurs significant communication overheads. To achieve the best of both worlds, we propose the Serverless Hierarchical Federated Learning (SHFL) framework in this article. The SHFL framework adopts a two-layer system architecture. In the lower layer, the FL workers are grouped into clusters under cluster heads. In the upper layer, the cluster heads exchange the intermediate parameters with their one-hop neighbors without the aid of a central server. To improve the sustainable efficiency of the FL system while taking into account the incentive design for workers’ marginal contributions in the system, we propose the reputation-aware hedonic coalition formation game in this article. Specifically, the workers are rewarded for their marginal contribution to the cluster, whereas the reputation opinions of each cluster head is updated in a decentralized manner, thereby deterring malicious behaviors by the cluster head. This improves the performance of the network since cluster heads with higher reputation scores are more reliable in relaying the intermediate model parameters. The simulation results show that our proposed hedonic coalition formation algorithm converges to a Nash-stable partition and improves the network efficiency.},

	abstract = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with modern sensors and sensor-based devices, will significantly stimulate the development of context-aware applications. An effective means to extract higher-level contextual information from sensor data is distributed complex event processing (CEP), which facilitates the analysis of real-time data streams coming from heterogeneous and distributed sources. Considering that user context is inherently sensitive information, the preservation of privacy is critical once the processing of user context takes place over several (possibly malicious) devices, especially in collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a trust-based approach for the placement and execution of CEP operators in a distributed environment. We propose a trust management model based on communication interactions among the users. Furthermore, we incorporate trust recommendations using a cosine-based similarity check in order to overcome collusion and on-off attacks. We developed a smartphone-based distributed CEP system called TrustCEP to evaluate our approach for trust management. Based on the evaluation of TrustCEP, we observe that our approach induces a minimal increase in average battery consumption compared to privacy-negligent approaches.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing, a new paradigm in distributed computing, has gained wide popularity in a relatively short span of time. With the increase in the number, functionality and features of cloud services, it is more and more mind-boggling for the cloud users to ﬁnd a trustworthy provider. Cloud users need to have conﬁdence in cloud providers to migrate their critical data to cloud computing. There must be some means to determine reliability of service providers so that users can choose services with the assurance that the provider will not act malignantly. An effort has been made in this paper to formulate a hybrid model to calculate the trustworthiness of service providers. Cloud services are evaluated and trust value is calculated based on compliance and reputation. Service logs based compliance reﬂects dynamic trust. The reputation has been computed from collective user feedback. Feedback rating is the view of each user about the invoked services. The discovered services that fulﬁll the user requirements are ranked based on their trust values and top-k cloud services are recommended to the user. The proposed approach is efﬁcient and considerably improves service-selection process in cloud applications.},

In this environment, confidences are insufficient for the customers to identify the trustworthy cloud service providers. Therefore, in this system, an important challenge is assessing the trustworthiness to enable the users for choosing the trustworthy resources in the cloud infrastructure. However, in the cloud environments, despite the significance of the trust mechanisms and methods, the comprehensive and systematic research and study about the background of the trust evaluation methods between the cloud providers is rare. Hence, in this paper, we analyzed the trust evaluation state of the art mechanisms which are used in the cloud environment so far. Also, we analyzed and compared them in terms of integrity, security, reliability, dependability, safety, dynamicity, confidentiality, scalability, and giving a suggestion for some future research.

	abstract = {In online marketplaces (e-commerce, cloud marketplaces), potential buyers/consumers do not have direct access to inspect the quality of products and services offered by retailers and service providers of marketplaces. Therefore, consumers have to trust the reputation system of the marketplace for making a meaningful decision whether they should have interaction with the particular service provider or not. Consumer’s feedback plays an important role while evaluating the trustworthiness of the service provider, but it brings challenges to security and the consumer’s privacy. Existing centralized reputation systems collect and process consumer’s feedback at the centralized trusted system but these systems could leak sensitive information of consumers (such as buying history, likes and dislikes). To ensure the privacy of consumers, in this paper, we present PrivBox, a privacy-preserving decentralized reputation system that computes reputation of retailers or service providers by leveraging feedback from users in a secure and private way. The PrivBox system uses primitives of a homomorphic cryptographic system and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof to achieve objectives of privacy-preservation and well-formedness. PrixBox performs its operations in a decentralized setting, and ensures the following characteristics. (1) It guarantees privacy of consumers without relying on any trusted setup or trusted third party system, (2) it ensures that the consumer’s feedback ratings remain within the prescribed range, and (3) it enables consumers and service providers to verify the computed statistics without relying on a trusted third party. To evaluate the performance, we have implemented operations of the PrivBox system. The results demonstrate that the proposed system has a small communication and computation overheads with the essential properties of privacy-preservation and decentralization.},

	abstract = {E-commerce markets can increase their efficiency through the usage of intelligent agents which negotiate and execute contracts on behalf of their owners. The measurement and computation of trust to secure interactions between autonomous agents is crucial for the success of automated e-commerce markets. Building a knowledge sharing network among peer agents helps to overcome trust-related boundaries in an environment where least human intervention is desired. Nevertheless, a risk management model which allows individual customisation to meet the different security needs of agent–owners is vital. The calculation and measurement of trust in unsupervised virtual communities like multi-agent environments involves complex aspects such as credibility rating for opinions delivered by peer agents, or the assessment of past experiences with the peer node one wishes to interact with. The deployment of suitable algorithms and models imitating human reasoning can help to solve these problems. This paper proposes not only a customisable trust evaluation model based on fuzzy logic but also demonstrates the integration of post-interaction processes like business interaction reviews and credibility adjustment. Fuzzy logic provides a natural framework to deal with uncertainty and the tolerance of imprecise data inputs to fuzzy-based systems makes fuzzy reasoning especially attractive for the subjective tasks of trust evaluation, business-interaction review and credibility adjustment.},

First, a trusted third party-based service brokering architecture is proposed for multiple cloud environment, in which the T-broker acts as a middleware for cloud trust management and service matching. Then, T-broker uses a hybrid and adaptive trust model to compute the overall trust degree of service resources, in which trust is defined as a fusion evaluation result from adaptively combining the direct monitored evidence with the social feedback of the service resources. More importantly, T-broker uses the maximizing deviation method to compute the direct experience based on multiple key trusted attributes of service resources, which can overcome the limitations of traditional trust schemes, in which the trusted attributes are weighted manually or subjectively. Finally, T-broker uses a lightweight feedback mechanism, which can effectively reduce networking risk and improve system efficiency. The experimental results show that, compared with the existing approaches, our T-broker yields very good results in many typical cases, and the proposed system is robust to deal with various numbers of dynamic service behavior from multiple cloud sites.},

Users pay for their use of services without needing to spend massive amounts for integration, maintenance, or management of the IT infrastructure. Before interaction occurs between cloud providers and users, trust in the cloud relationship is very important to minimize the security risk and malicious attacks. The notion of trust involves several dimensions. These dimensions include: the scalability, availability, security, and usability parameters of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and DaaS. Each of these dimensions is characterized by fuzzy aspects and linguistic terms. This paper develops a model for each of the dimensions for IaaS using fuzzy-set theory. It then uses the sugeno fuzzy-inference approach for developing an overall measure of trust value of the cloud providers. It is not easy to evaluate the cloud metrics for a general domain. So, in this paper, we will use an e-learning application as the main example when we collect the data and apply the fuzzy model to evaluate the trust for cloud computing. Test and results are presented to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model.},

Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a differentiating point of services to attract customers. Since the QoS of services varies widely among users due to the unpredicted network, physical location and other objective factors, many Collaborative Filtering based approaches are recently proposed to predict the unknown QoS by employing the historical user-contributed QoS data. However, most existing approaches ignore the data credibility problem and are thus vulnerable to the unreliable QoS data contributed by dishonest users. To address this problem, we propose a trust-aware approach TAP for reliable personalized QoS prediction. Firstly, we cluster the users and calculate the reputation of users based on the clustering information by a beta reputation system. Secondly, a set of trustworthy similar users is identified according to the calculated user reputation and similarity. Finally, we identify a set of similar services by clustering the services and make prediction for active users by combining the QoS data of the trustworthy similar users and similar services. Comprehensive real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this model, the user’s historical behavior will be used to construct a set of trusted behavior of the cloud users. On this basis, the direct trust of the user’s behavior can be obtained. Then, the recommendation trust can be calculated by the interaction between the users and other cloud users. Given the current historical trust, the comprehensive trust can be obtained using the weighted average method. Among them, the initial value of historical trust is set to a constant and then updated by the comprehensive trust. In order to control the user’s abnormal behavior more effectively, the suspicious threshold value and the abnormal threshold value were defined, which are used to punish the historical trust.

It challenges the design and evaluation of IoT systems to meet the scalability, compatibility, extendibility, dynamic adaptability and resiliency requirements.

Recognizing that entities in an IoT system are connected through social networks of entity owners, we consider a community of interest (CoI) based social IoT where nodes form into communities of interest. Given inter-CoI vs. intra-CoI social connections among entity owners as input, we identify best trust protocol settings for achieving convergence, accuracy, dynamic adaptability and resiliency properties in the presence of dynamically changing conditions and malicious nodes performing trust-related attacks. For scalability, we consider a design by which a node only keeps trust information of a subset of nodes meeting its interest and performs minimum computation to update trust. We validate our design by extensive simulation considering both limited and ideal (unlimited) storage space. The results demonstrate that our trust management protocol using limited storage space achieves a similar performance level compared with the one under ideal storage space, and a newly joining node can quickly build up trust towards other nodes with desirable accuracy and convergence behavior.},

TSPs are distributed over the clouds, and they elicit raw trust evidence from different sources and in different formats. This evidence is information regarding the adherence of a CSP to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for a cloud-based service and the feedback sent by CSUs. Using this information, they evaluate an objective trust and a subjective trust of CSPs. TSPs communicate among themselves through a trust propagation network that permits a TSP to obtain trust information about a CSP from other TSPs.

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a model to enable the convenient access to the network request for sharing the groups of configurable calculating resources. In this environment, confidences are insufficient for the customers to identify the trustworthy cloud service providers. Therefore, in this system, an important challenge is assessing the trustworthiness to enable the users for choosing the trustworthy resources in the cloud infrastructure. However, in the cloud environments, despite the significance of the trust mechanisms and methods, the comprehensive and systematic research and study about the background of the trust evaluation methods between the cloud providers is rare. Hence, in this paper, we analyzed the trust evaluation state of the art mechanisms which are used in the cloud environment so far. Also, we analyzed and compared them in terms of integrity, security, reliability, dependability, safety, dynamicity, confidentiality, scalability, and giving a suggestion for some future research. Also, this article displays a systematic literature review (SLR) on the trust evaluation mechanisms in the cloud environments up to the end of March 2017. We identified 224 articles, which are reduced to 28 primary ones through our article selection process. By presenting the state-of-the-art information and the challenges issues, this survey will directly support academics, researchers, and professionals in their understanding of changes in the trust evaluation mechanisms in the cloud environments.},

As a result of wide-range availability of cloud services with similar functionalities, it is very crucial to determine which service best addresses the user’s desires and objectives. This paper aims to design a new cloud service selection model under the fuzzy environment by utilizing the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The AHP method is enforced to configure the structure of cloud service selection problem and to impel the criteria weight using the pairwise comparisons, and the TOPSIS method utilizes the final ranking of the solution. In our proposed model, the non-functional quality of service requirements is taken into consideration for selecting appropriate service. Furthermore, the proposed model exploits a set of pre-defined linguistic variables, parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers for evaluating each criteria weights. The experimental results obtained using the real-time cloud service domains prove the efficacy of our proposed model and demonstrate the effectiveness by inducing better performance, when compared against other available cloud service selection algorithms. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is persuaded to confirm the robustness of our proposed model.},

In the era of cloud computing, this compliance management issue is exacerbated by the distributed nature of the system and by the limited control that customers have on the services. Today, the cloud industry is aware of this problem (as evidenced by the compliance program of many cloud service providers), and the research community is addressing the many facets of the legal-rule compliance checking and quality assurance problem. Cloud service brokerage plays an important role in legislation compliance and QoS management of cloud services. In this paper we discuss our experience in designing a legal-rule and QoS-aware cloud service broker, and we explore relate research issues. Specifically we provide three main contributions to the literature: first, we describe the detailed design architecture of the legal-rule and QoS-aware broker. Second, we discuss our design choices which rely on the state of the art solutions available in literature. We cover four main research areas: cloud broker service deployment, seamless cloud service migration, cloud service monitoring, and legal rule compliance checking.

However, the identification of trustworthy cloud services imposes difficulties due to the multiplicity and the resemblance in their functionality. The shortage of proficient trust management schemes for services prevents the large-scale adoption of cloud computing paradigm by the public. In this paper, we propose trust management middleware (TMM), a framework for trustworthy service selection in the cloud. TMM performs service selection by integrating subjective assessment from users and objective assessment from service monitors. We proposed a new covariance based algorithm to determine the credibility of user feedback. Also, in our model, a novel objective trust evaluation algorithm is proposed based on prioritization of quality of service parameters depending on the user preferences. The results show that the proposed framework improves the accuracy of trust evaluation considerably and is more efficient in identifying trustworthy cloud services as compared with the other relevant methods.},

We argue that given the nature of both binary and property based attestation mechanisms, an attestation requester cannot be absolutely certain if an attesting platform will behave as it is expected to behave. TESM uses a hybrid trust model based on subjective logic to combine ‘hard’ trust from measurements and properties and ‘soft’ trust from past experiences and recommendations to reduce such uncertainties. We believe that such a model will enable better reasoning about the trustworthiness of attesting platforms and thereby facilitate better security decision making.},

The VM selection policy uses utilization data to choose a VM for migration, while the VM allocation policy designates VMs to a host based on its service reputation.

In this paper, we propose a collaborative SLA and Reputation-based Trust Management (RTM) solution for federated cloud environment. The SLA service defines clearly the performance metrics and measures the actual performance of the deployed cloud applications. Based on the SLA, the RTM service of the collaborative solution leverages several technical and user’s experience metrics to compute the reliability of the cloud providers and the credibility of the customers. A proof of concept of the collaborative solution in a realistic federated environment is provided and validated.

	abstract = {Cross-Cloud Federation (CCF) is beneficial for heterogeneous Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for leasing additional resources from each other. Despite the benefits of on-demand scalability and enhanced service footprints for better service quality, the adoption of CCF is however mainly hindered due to the lack of a comprehensive trust model. The basic aim of such a model should be to address the security and performance concerns of a home CSP on its foreign peers before placing its users’ data and applications in their premises. A transitivity of users’ trust on home CSP and home CSP's trust on its foreign CSPs marks the uniqueness of trust paradigm in CCF. Addressing the concerns of cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm is inevitable to achieve users’ trust in a federation. Various trust models have been proposed in literature for conventional and multi-cloud computing environments. They focus on user requirements but none on federation perspective. Their applicability to CCF for addressing the concerns of cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm requires further consideration. For this reason, we have first outlined the general characteristics of CCF as being dynamic, multi-level and heterogeneous. Afterwards, cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm is proposed based on a set of unique principles identified as (i) trust bi-directionality, (ii) trust composition, (iii) delegation control, and (iv) Resource awareness. An insightful review of Trust Management Systems (TMS) proposed in literature reveals their shortcomings in addressing the requirements of cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm. To overcome these shortcomings, we suggest that some challenges can be merely addressed by aligning the existing methods to the nature of CCF. The remaining challenges require entirely new mechanisms to be introduced. A demonstration of this concept is presented in the form of a requirement matrix suggesting how the characteristics and properties of both CCF and the TMS are influenced by each other. This requirement matrix reveals the potential avenues of research for a TMS aimed specifically for CCF.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel trust computation framework (TCF) for cloud services. Trust is computed by taking into consideration multi-dimensional quality of service (QoS) evidence and user feedback. Feedback provides ample evidence regarding the quality of experience (QoE) of cloud service users. However, in some cases, users may behave maliciously and report false feedback. Users can carry out collusion and Sybil attacks to slander/self-promote cloud services. Trust computed in such cases could be misleading and inaccurate. Evaluating the credibility of user feedback can help in not only preventing the collusion and Sybil attacks but also remunerating the affected cloud services. Despite the advantages of credibility evaluation, very few studies take into consideration feedback credibility and multi-dimensional evaluation criteria. Considering the limitations of existing studies, we propose a new TCF in which trust is computed by aggregating multi-dimensional evidence from QoS and QoE. We have used multi-dimensional QoS attributes to compute the objective trust of cloud services. The QoS attributes are divided into three dimensions, i.e., node profile, average resource consumption, and performance. The node profile of a cloud service is attributed to CPU frequency, memory size, and hard disk capacity. The average resource consumption is quantified based on the current CPU utilisation rate, current memory utilisation rate, current hard disk utilisation rate, and energy consumption. Moreover, the performance of a cloud service is measured by the average response time and task success ratio. Besides that, the credibility of feedback is evaluated to prevent the malicious behaviour of cloud users. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TCF in computing accurate trust in cloud services.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is an emerging machine learning technique that enables distributed model training using local datasets from large-scale nodes, e.g., mobile devices, but shares only model updates without uploading the raw training data. This technique provides a promising privacy preservation for mobile devices while simultaneously ensuring high learning performance. The majority of existing work has focused on designing advanced learning algorithms with an aim to achieve better learning performance. However, the challenges, such as incentive mechanisms for participating in training and worker (i.e., mobile devices) selection schemes for reliable federated learning, have not been explored yet. These challenges have hindered the widespread adoption of federated learning. To address the above challenges, in this article, we first introduce reputation as the metric to measure the reliability and trustworthiness of the mobile devices. We then design a reputation-based worker selection scheme for reliable federated learning by using a multiweight subjective logic model. We also leverage the blockchain to achieve secure reputation management for workers with nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties in a decentralized manner.

	abstract = {Mobile ad hoc networks are deployed under the assumption that participating nodes are willing to forward other nodes’ packets. However, for civilian applications where nodes are not owned by a single entity but are profit-oriented independent agents, cooperation cannot be taken for granted. In this paper, we present a novel reputation computation model to discover and prevent selfish behaviors by combining familiarity values with subjective opinions. The familiarity value represents a node’s familiar degree with another individual node. In our model, a node that queries another’s reputation first accumulates subjective opinions from their common neighbors. The familiarity values are used to calculate the weighting factor that determines how much a node’s recommending opinion impacts on the reputation computation result. The utilization of this familiarity allows nodes to obtain opinions with lower uncertainty values, which helps nodes to recognize selfish nodes much earlier and can decrease the convergence time for isolating selfish nodes. We evaluate the performance of our model based on ns-2 simulations to analyze the impact of different parameters on the network performance. The simulation results show that our model outperforms the pure subjective logic-based model and achieves up to a 25\% improvement in the convergence time.},

To ensure security and traceability of data sharing, existing studies utilize efficient delegated proof-of-stake consensus scheme as hard security solutions to establish blockchain-enabled IoV (BIoV). However, as the miners are selected from miner candidates by stake-based voting, defending against voting collusion between the candidates and compromised high-stake vehicles becomes challenging. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a two-stage soft security enhancement solution: 1) miner selection and 2) block verification. In the first stage, we design a reputation-based voting scheme to ensure secure miner selection. This scheme evaluates candidates' reputation using both past interactions and recommended opinions from other vehicles. The candidates with high reputation are selected to be active miners and standby miners. In the second stage, to prevent internal collusion among active miners, a newly generated block is further verified and audited by standby miners. To incentivize the participation of the standby miners in block verification, we adopt the contract theory to model the interactions between active miners and standby miners, where block verification security and delay are taken into consideration. Numerical results based on a real-world dataset confirm the security and efficiency of our schemes for data sharing in BIoV.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) provides ubiquitous intelligence and pervasive interconnections to diverse physical objects. The overall network performance of existing IoT is restricted by limited network lifetime. Hence, energy harvesting technology with energy replenishment from mobile charger is proposed to prolong the network lifetime. Energy harvesting IoT is emerged. Nodes can not only request energy replenishment from the mobile charger, but also transfer surplus energy to the mobile charger for improving energy utilization. This gives rise to bidirectional energy flows in the network. A new paradigm that energy flows coexist with data flows is further resulted in. But there exist great challenges on controlling these flows. Toward centralized flow control, we exploit software defined networking to simplify and optimize network management, thus introduce software defined energy harvesting IoT (SEANET). In our proposed architecture, the data plane, energy plane, and control plane are decoupled to support enhanced communications and flexible energy scheduling. We consider reliable communications for SEANET, and propose to relay data packets among the nodes with high reputation values and sufficient energy. In particular, reputation values of nodes are computed by the multiweighted subjective logic for higher accuracy. Besides, a Nash bargaining game is formulated to solve the benefit allocation problem for energy trading in SEANET. Numerical results indicate that SEANET improves data traffic by reducing packet loss, optimizes energy utilization, and saves energy.},

Nodes that act selfishly or even maliciously pose a threat to availability in mobile adhoc networks. Several approaches have been proposed to detect noncooperative nodes. In this paper, we investigate the effect of using rumors with respect to the detection time of misbehaved nodes as well as the robustness of the reputation system against wrong accusations. We propose a Bayesian approach for reputation representation, updates, and view integration. We also present a mechanism to detect and exclude potential lies. The simulation results indicate that by using this Bayesian approach, the reputation system is robust against slander while still benefitting from the speed-up in detection time provided by the use of rumors.},

Simple solutions such as exclusively relying on one`s own direct observations have drawbacks, as they do not make use of all the information available. We propose a fully distributed reputation system that can cope with false disseminated information. In our approach, everyone maintains a reputation rating and a trust rating about everyone else that they care about. From time to time first-hand reputation information is exchanged with others; using a modified Bayesian approach we designed and present in this paper, only second-hand reputation information that is not incompatible with the current reputation rating is accepted. Thus, reputation ratings are slightly modified by accepted information. Trust ratings are updated based on the compatibility of second-hand reputation information with prior reputation ratings. Data is entirely distributed: someone`s reputation and trust is the collection of ratings maintained by others. We enable node redemption and prevent the sudden exploitation of good reputation built over time by introducing re-evaluation and reputation fading. We present the application of our generic reputation system to the context of neighborhood watch in mobile ad-hoc networks, specifically to the CONFIDANT {\textbackslash}cite\{buchegger:performance\} protocol for the detection and isolation of nodes exhibiting routing or forwarding misbehavior.

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a type of distributed machine learning approacs that trains global models through the collaboration of participants. It protects data privacy as participants only contribute local models instead of sharing private local data. However, the performance of FL highly relies on the number of participants and their contributions. When applying FL over conventional computer networks, attracting more participants, encouraging participants to contribute more local resources, and enabling efficient and effective collaboration among participants become very challenging. As software-defined networks (SDNs) enable open and flexible networking architecture with separate control and data planes, SDNs provide standardized protocols and specifications to enable fine-grained collaborations among devices. Applying FL approaches over SDNs can take use such advantages to address challenges. A SDN control plane can have multiple controllers organized in layers; the controllers in the lower layer can be placed in the network edge to deal with the asymmetries in the attached switches and hosts, and the controller in the upper layer can supervise the whole network centrally and globally. Applying FL in SDNs with a layered-distributed control plane may be able to protect the data privacy of each participant while improving collaboration among participants to produce higher-quality models over asymmetric networks. Accordingly, this paper aims to make a comprehensive survey on the related mechanisms and solutions that enable FL in SDNs. It highlights three major challenges, an incentive mechanism, privacy and security, and model aggregation, which affect the quality and quantity of participants, the security and privacy in model transferring, and the performance of the global model, respectively. The state of the art in mechanisms and solutions that can be applied to address such challenges in the current literature are categorized based on the challenges they face, followed by suggestions of future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort in surveying the state of the art in combining FL with SDNs.},

	abstract = {In recent years, mobile devices are equipped with increasingly advanced sensing and computing capabilities. Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in FL.},

FL is reshaping existing industry paradigms for mathematical modeling and analysis, enabling an increasing number of industries to build privacy-preserving, secure distributed machine learning models. However, the inherent characteristics of FL have led to problems such as privacy protection, communication cost, systems heterogeneity, and unreliability model upload in actual operation. Interestingly, the integration with Blockchain technology provides an opportunity to further improve the FL security and performance, besides increasing its scope of applications. Therefore, we denote this integration of Blockchain and FL as the Blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) framework. This paper introduces an in-depth survey of BCFL and discusses the insights of such a new paradigm. In particular, we first briefly introduce the FL technology and discuss the challenges faced by such technology. Then, we summarize the Blockchain ecosystem. Next, we highlight the structural design and platform of BCFL. Furthermore, we present the attempts ins improving FL performance with Blockchain and several combined applications of incentive mechanisms in FL. Finally, we summarize the industrial application scenarios of BCFL.},

The highly dynamic, distributed, and non-transparent nature of cloud services introduces several challenging issues such as privacy, security, and availability.

Protecting cloud services against their malicious users (e.g., such users might give misleading feedback to disadvantage a particular cloud service) is a difficult problem. Guaranteeing the availability of the trust management service is another significant challenge because of the dynamic nature of cloud environments. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of CloudArmor, a reputation-based trust management framework that provides a set of functionalities to deliver trust as a service (TaaS), which includes i) a novel protocol to prove the credibility of trust feedbacks and preserve users' privacy, ii) an adaptive and robust credibility model for measuring the credibility of trust feedbacks to protect cloud services from malicious users and to compare the trustworthiness of cloud services, and iii) an availability model to manage the availability of the decentralized implementation of the trust management service.

A P2P grid is a special case of grid networks in which P2P communications are used for communication between nodes and trust management.

Semantic grids have appeared as an expansion of grid networks in which rich resource metadata are revealed and clearly handled. In a semantic P2P grid, nodes are clustered into different groups based on the semantic similarities between their services. This paper proposes a reputation model for trust management in a semantic P2P Grid. We use fuzzy theory, in a trust overlay network named FR TRUST that models the network structure and the storage of reputation information. In fact we present a reputation collection and computation system for semantic P2P Grids. The system uses fuzzy theory to compute a peer trust level, which can be either: Low, Medium, or High. Our experimental results demonstrate that FR TRUST combines low (and therefore desirable) a good computational complexity with high ranking accuracy.},

	abstract = {Trustworthy transmission is a beneficial step toward the success of the new era of telecommunication technologies and online social networks (OSNs). Many sensitive applications can benefit from OSNs, e.g., eHealth and medical services. However, OSNs have always been prey to Sybil attacks where numerous fake nodes are being generated and propagated in social networks to mimic like real nodes for the purpose of achieving malicious goals. Thus, for security reasons and for the sensitivity of data used in eHealth applications, such fake nodes have to be detected and deactivated immediately. The emerging field of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) promotes trust management (TM) among various IoMT devices to provide accurate and reliable communications, which is quite essential in critical diseases such as COVID-19. TM provides a secure platform to IoMT devices using different security protocols in the IoMT network. Generically, if a device is not comfortable to connect with additional devices in a network, the motive of the communication process is not succeeded and leads to disappointment for one device toward others. To handle these types of situations, a TM mechanism, named fuzzy-based TM mechanism for preventing Sybil attacks in the Internet of Medical Things (FTM-IoMT), is proposed. The FTM-IoMT provides TM for the users of eHealth systems using IoMT infrastructures. It is an intelligent mechanism to recognize Sybil or untrustworthy nodes in the system. The proposed mechanism helps IoMT nodes to collect authentic and credible information from their neighboring nodes as well as to neglect Sybil nodes. The trust value of a node is evaluated using fuzzy logic processing followed by the trust attributes, such as integrity, receptivity, and compatibility of a node. The FTM-IoMT provides a double evaluation check based on fuzzy logic processing and fuzzy filter. The proposed scheme shows superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {The 5G network solutions currently standardised and deployed do not yet enable the full potential of pervasive networking and computing envisioned in 5G initial visions: network services and slices with different QoS profiles do not span multiple operators; security, trust and automation is limited. The evolution of 5G towards a truly production-level stage needs to heavily rely on automated end-to-end network operations, use of distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) for cognitive network orchestration and management and minimal manual interventions (zero-touch automation). All these elements are key to implement highly pervasive network infrastructures. Moreover, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can be adopted to implement distributed security and trust through Smart Contracts among multiple non-trusted parties. In this paper, we propose an initial concept of a zero-touch security and trust architecture for ubiquitous computing and connectivity in 5G networks. Our architecture aims at cross-domain security \& trust orchestration mechanisms by coupling DLTs with AI-driven operations and service lifecycle automation in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments.

	abstract = {With the emergence of new network paradigms, network operators are able to provide slices (multiple simultaneous logical networks) thanks to Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-defined networking (SDN) technologies. Currently, network operators do not have the means to commit on energy consumption, although it is a growing request from their customers. Indeed, given that energy consumption does not appear in slice Service Level Agreements (SLA) nor in Virtual Network Function Descriptors (VNFD), slice automated management systems cannot take this criterion into account. This paper addresses this issue with two contributions. First, we extend VNFD to include energy consumption. Second, we propose an SLA template for slices which includes energy based commitments. This template is complemented by some metrics in order to detect any deviation. Both contributions are illustrated by a use case. Our aim is to allow the entity in charge of referencing and placement of the virtual network functions (VNFs) for network service-composition purpose, to take into account energy consumption in addition to other preexisting aspects. This will help the network provider to commit on energy consumption with his customers through enhanced SLAs.},

	abstract = {The virtualization of operating systems and network functions results in a large amount of virtual machines (VM) that are hosted in data-center servers called physical machines (PM). This requires an efficient management and consolidation in order to use as few physical resources as possible to reduce the energy consumption. This paper addresses the VM placement problem with the aim of minimizing energy consumption as well as optimizing resource wastage in a data center. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach based on statistical methods to measure the similarity between resource vectors of PMs and VMs. The proposed strategy allows minimizing the wastage of resources by placing VMs on PMs while keeping the intra-workload balancing of the different resources. The energy consumption minimization is taken into account by reinforcing the selection of the target PM criterion as well as the growth rate of energy consumption. The energy efficiency and the optimization of resource wastage are demonstrated through simulation experiments. The obtained results show that our proposed IRB- VMP algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art FFD and BFD algorithms regarding the considered metrics.},

This study identifies representative estimates for the average electricity intensity of fixed‐line Internet transmission networks over time and suggests criteria for making accurate estimates in the future. Differences in system boundary, assumptions used, and year to which the data apply significantly affect such estimates. Surprisingly, methodology used is not a major source of error, as has been suggested in the past. This article derives criteria to identify accurate estimates over time and provides a new estimate of 0.06 kWh/GB for 2015. By retroactively applying our criteria to existing studies, we were able to determine that the electricity intensity of data transmission (core and fixed‐line access networks) has decreased by half approximately every 2 years since 2000 (for developed countries), a rate of change comparable to that found in the efficiency of computing more generally.},

	abstract = {Threshold cryptography is a fundamental distributed computational paradigm for enhancing the availability and the security of cryptographic public-key schemes. It does it by dividing private keys into n shares handed out to distinct servers. In threshold signature schemes, a set of at least t+1≤n servers is needed to produce a valid digital signature. Availability is assured by the fact that any subset of t+1 servers can produce a signature when authorized. At the same time, the scheme should remain robust (in the fault tolerance sense) and unforgeable (cryptographically) against up to t corrupted servers; i.e., it adds quorum control to traditional cryptographic services and introduces redundancy. Originally, most practical threshold signatures have a number of demerits: They have been analyzed in a static corruption model (where the set of corrupted servers is fixed at the very beginning of the attack); they require interaction; they assume a trusted dealer in the key generation phase (so that the system is not fully distributed); or they suffer from certain overheads in terms of storage (large share sizes). In this paper, we construct practical fully distributed (the private key is born distributed), non-interactive schemes—where the servers can compute their partial signatures without communication with other servers—with adaptive security (i.e., the adversary corrupts servers dynamically based on its full view of the history of the system). Our schemes are very efficient in terms of computation, communication, and scalable storage (with private key shares of size O(1), where certain solutions incur O(n) storage costs at each server). Unlike other adaptively secure schemes, our schemes are erasure-free (reliable erasure is hard to assure and hard to administer properly in actual systems). To the best of our knowledge, such a fully distributed highly constrained scheme has been an open problem in the area. In particular, and of special interest, is the fact that Pedersen's traditional distributed key generation (DKG) protocol can be safely employed in the initial key generation phase when the system is born—although it is well-known not to ensure uniformly distributed public keys. An advantage of this is that this protocol only takes one round optimistically (in the absence of faulty player).},

	abstract = {In many dynamic open systems, autonomous agents must interact with one another to achieve their goals. Such agents may be self-interested and, when trusted to perform an action, may betray that trust by not performing the action as required. Due to the scale and dynamism of these systems, agents will often need to interact with other agents with which they have little or no past experience. Each agent must therefore be capable of assessing and identifying reliable interaction partners, even if it has no personal experience with them. To this end, we present HABIT, a Hierarchical And Bayesian Inferred Trust model for assessing how much an agent should trust its peers based on direct and third party information. This model is robust in environments in which third party information is malicious, noisy, or otherwise inaccurate. Although existing approaches claim to achieve this, most rely on heuristics with little theoretical foundation. In contrast, HABIT is based exclusively on principled statistical techniques: it can cope with multiple discrete or continuous aspects of trustee behaviour; it does not restrict agents to using a single shared representation of behaviour; it can improve assessment by using any observed correlation between the behaviour of similar trustees or information sources; and it provides a pragmatic solution to the whitewasher problem (in which unreliable agents assume a new identity to avoid bad reputation). In this paper, we describe the theoretical aspects of HABIT, and present experimental results that demonstrate its ability to predict agent behaviour in both a simulated environment, and one based on data from a real-world webserver domain. In particular, these experiments show that HABIT can predict trustee performance based on multiple representations of behaviour, and is up to twice as accurate as BLADE, an existing state-of-the-art trust model that is both statistically principled and has been previously shown to outperform a number of other probabilistic trust models.},

Hence, it is difficult for the users to evaluate these cloud services and select them to fit their QoCS requirements. In this paper, we propose an accurate evaluation approach of QoCS in service-oriented cloud computing. We first employ fuzzy synthetic decision to evaluate cloud service providers according to cloud users’ preferences and then adopt cloud model to computing the uncertainty of cloud services based on monitored QoCS data. Finally, we obtain the evaluation results of QoCS using fuzzy logic control. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can perform an accurate evaluation of QoCS in service-oriented cloud computing.},

A dynamic evidence-based trust model is proposed to ascertain dynamic trustworthiness on services in the cloud environment. The trust model employs fuzzy logic to derive trust value in order to handle the uncertainty and uses induced ordered weight averaging operator to aggregate the trust values, thus enabling the real-time performance.

Additionally, although the new generation of cellular networks (5G) can dramatically improve the transmission efficiency of the messages, many existing authentication schemes are based on complex bilinear pairing operations, and the calculation time is too long to be suitable for delay-sensitive 5G-enabled vehicular networks. To address these issues, we propose a reputation system-based lightweight message authentication framework and protocol for 5G-enabled vehicular networks. The trusted authority (TA) is in charge of reputation management. A vehicle with a reputation score below the given threshold cannot obtain a credit reference from the TA for participating in the communication; therefore, the number of untrusted messages in vehicular networks is reduced from the source. Security analysis shows that our scheme is secure against an adaptively chosen-message attack, and also satisfies a series of requirements of vehicular networks. The scheme is based on the elliptic curve cryptosystem and supports batch authentication; therefore, it shows better performance in terms of time consumption when compared with related schemes.},

The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.},

To enhance security in distributed networks, such as ad hoc networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of participating entities since trust is the major driving force for collaboration. In this paper, we present a framework to quantitatively measure trust, model trust propagation, and defend trust evaluation systems against malicious attacks. In particular, we address the fundamental understanding of trust, quantitative trust metrics, mathematical properties of trust, dynamic properties of trust, and trust models. The attacks against trust evaluation are identified and defense techniques are developed. The proposed trust evaluation system is employed in ad hoc networks for securing ad hoc routing and assisting malicious node detection. The implementation is fully distributed. Simulations show that the proposed system can significantly improve network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks. Further, extensive simulations are performed to illustrate various attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed defense techniques.},

However, existing consensus algorithms used in blockchains have been designed to work in a fully connected network with reliable communication. As this assumption does not hold anymore in mobile wireless networks, we describe in this paper the problem of network partitions and its impact on blockchain. Then, we propose a new consensus algorithm called Consensus for Mesh (C4M) which inspires from RAFT as a solution to this problem. The C4M consensus algorithm is integrated in Blockgraph, a blockchain solution for MANET and mesh networks. We implemented our solution in NS-3 to analyze its performances through simulations. The simulation results show that the heartbeat interval and the election timeout have a great impact on the leader election time, especially in case of topology changes.},

The virtualization of network functions enables the functional split of radio access network functions to fulfill different 5G radio access network requirements. Functional split can be expressed as deciding the distribution of radio access network functionalities between the radio unit placed at the edge of the network, the distributed unit placed close to the users, and the central unit placed centrally. The open radio access network concept is utilized to achieve a virtualized, interoperable radio access network among multiple vendors. In this work, we considered the placement of radio access network slices in a multi-tier 5G open radio access network architecture and formulated the problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming, considering different functional split options for each network slice separately. Our results showed that flexible functional split utilizes physical network resources and satisfies different network slice requirements better than fixed functional split options.},

In so doing, we critically evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of the main models that have been proposed and show how, fundamentally, they all seek to minimise the uncertainty in interactions.

	abstract = {One of the major challenges for electronic commerce is how to establish a relationship of trust between different parties. Establishing trust is nontrivial, because the traditional physical or social means of trust cannot apply directly in virtual settings. In many cases, the parties involved may not ever have interacted before. Reputation systems seek to address the development of trust by recording the reputations of different parties. However, most existing reputation systems are restricted to individual market websites. Further, relevant information about a party may come from several websites and from interactions that were not mediated by any website. This paper considers the problem of automatically collecting ratings about a given party from others. Our approach involves a distributed agent architecture and adapts the mathematical theory of evidence to represent and propagate the ratings that participants give to each other. When evaluating the trustworthiness of a given party, a peer combines its local evidence (based on direct prior interactions with the party) with the testimonies of others regarding the same party. This approach satisfies certain important properties of distributed reputation management and is experimentally evaluated through simulations.},

A multitude of trust and reputation systems have been proposed to try to cope with the problem of cheating. These systems are often evaluated by measuring their performance against simple agents that cheat randomly. Unfortunately, these systems are not often evaluated from the perspective of security—can a motivated attacker defeat the protection? Previously, it was argued that existing systems may suffer from vulnerabilities that permit effective, profitable cheating despite the use of the system. In this work, we experimentally substantiate the presence of these vulnerabilities by successfully implementing and testing a number of such ‘attacks’, which consist only of sequences of sales (honest and dishonest) that can be executed in the system. This investigation also reveals two new, previously-unnoted cheating techniques. Our success in executing these attacks compellingly makes a key point: security must be a central design goal for developers of trust and reputation systems.},

The basic idea is to have a mechanism for rating services on various aspects, and a way of computing reputation scores based on the ratings from many different parties. By making the reputation scores public, such systems can assist parties in deciding whether or not to use a particular service. Reputation systems represent soft security mechanisms for social control. This article presents a type of reputation system based on the Dirichlet probability distribution which is a multinomial Bayesian probability distribution. Dirichlet reputation systems represent a generalisation of the binomial Beta reputation system.

To this end, this paper presents FIRE, a trust and reputation model that integrates a number of information sources to produce a comprehensive assessment of an agent’s likely performance in open systems. Specifically, FIRE incorporates interaction trust, role-based trust, witness reputation, and certified reputation to provide trust metrics in most circumstances. FIRE is empirically evaluated and is shown to help agents gain better utility (by effectively selecting appropriate interaction partners) than our benchmarks in a variety of agent populations. It is also shown that FIRE is able to effectively respond to changes that occur in an agent’s environment.},

	abstract = {In the absence of legal enforcement procedures for the participants of an open e-marketplace, trust and reputation systems are central for resisting against threats from malicious agents. Such systems provide mechanisms for identifying the participants who disseminate unfair ratings. However, it is possible that some of the honest participants are also victimized as a consequence of the poor judgement of these systems. In this paper, we propose a two-layer ﬁltering algorithm that cognitively elicits the behavioral characteristics of the participating agents in an e-marketplace. We argue that the notion of unfairness does not exclusively refer to deception but can also imply diﬀerences in dispositions. The proposed ﬁltering approach aims to go beyond the inﬂexible judgements on the quality of participants and instead allows the human dispositions that we call optimism, pessimism and realism to be incorporated into our trustworthiness evaluations. Our proposed ﬁltering algorithm consists of two layers. In the ﬁrst layer, a consumer agent measures the competency of its neighbors for being a potentially helpful adviser. Thus, it automatically disqualiﬁes the deceptive agents and/or the newcomers that lack the required experience. Afterwards, the second layer measures the credibility of the surviving agents of the previous layer on the basis of their behavioral models. This tangible view of trustworthiness evaluation boosts the conﬁdence of human users in using a web-based agent-oriented e-commerce application.},

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to detect the unfair ratings that cannot be effectively prevented by existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our algorithm is particularly effective to detect malicious raters that collaboratively manipulate ratings of one or several products. The main idea of our algorithm is to use an autoregressive signal modeling technique combined with trust-enhanced rating aggregation. We are able to detect and filter out unfair ratings very accurately. Extensive experiments through simulations and real-world data have been performed to validate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show significant improvements on detecting collaborative unfair raters over existing techniques.},

Methods have been proposed to filter the unfair testimonies in order to mitigate the influence of unfair testimonies. However, existing methods depend on assumptions that ratings follow a particular distribution to carry out the testimony filtering. This constrains them in specific rating systems and hinders their applications in other reputation systems. Moreover, existing methods do not scale well with the increase of testimony number due to their iterative nature. In this paper, a novel entropy-based method is proposed to measure the testimony quality, based on which unfair testimonies are further filtered. The proposed method does not require the assumption regarding the rating distribution. Moreover, it scales linearly with the increase of the testimony number. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in mitigating the influence of various types of unfair testimonies.},

This paper proposes a new gossip protocol for fast score aggregation. We developed a Bloom filter architecture for efficient score ranking. These techniques do not require any secure hashing or fast lookup mechanism, thus are applicable to both unstructured and structured P2P networks. We report the design principles and performance results of a simulated GossipTrust reputation system. Randomized gossiping with effective use of power nodes enables light-weight aggregation and fast dissemination of global scores in O(log2 n) time steps, where n is the P2P network size. The Gossip-based protocol is designed to tolerate dynamic peer joining and departure, as well as to avoid possible peer collusions. The scheme has a considerably low gossiping message overhead, i.e. O(n log2 n) messages for n nodes. Bloom filters demand at most 512 KB memory per node for a 10,000-node network. We evaluate the performance of GossipTrust with distributed P2P file-sharing and parameter-sweeping applications. The simulation results demonstrate that GossipTrust has small aggregation time, low memory demand, and high ranking accuracy. These results suggest promising advantages of using the GossipTrust system for trusted P2P applications.},

Because of the complexity of the issues, and the fact that the trust and reputation are essentially concerns with the relationships, it is important to clearly define the notion of the trust relationships and notion of the reputation relationships.

For nonsymmetric reputations, following the notion of reputation propagation along paths, we give a general asymmetric reputation function based on flow and give conditions for sybilproofness.},

In a commercial transaction, it is necessary to present reputation values of web services in a timely and a robust manner so as to counter the unfair ratings of malicious users. To address the time lag problem, most popular web sites use an averaging algorithm with fixed sliding windows, window size is constant and older ratings are dropped upon the arrival of new ratings. Herein, we propose a dynamic sliding window model that is capable of reflecting the reputation values yielded by the latest changes in services. Furthermore, we implement a statistical strategy to filter out unfair ratings by calculating the standard deviation of the ratings after transposing the two-dimensional linear window into the constant one-dimensional window by using linear regression. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model, it outperforms the existing reputation system by 40\% on average based on the 5 test cases examined, and also show that it can asymptotically converge to the underlying reputation value as ratings accumulate.},

Here, agents may be self-interested, and when trusted to perform an action for another, may betray that trust by not performing the action as required. In addition, due to the size of such systems, agents will often interact with other agents with which they have little or no past experience. There is therefore a need to develop a model of trust and reputation that will ensure good interactions among software agents in large scale open systems. Against this background, we have developed TRAVOS (Trust and Reputation model for Agent-based Virtual OrganisationS) which models an agent’s trust in an interaction partner. Specifically, trust is calculated using probability theory taking account of past interactions between agents, and when there is a lack of personal experience between agents, the model draws upon reputation information gathered from third parties. In this latter case, we pay particular attention to handling the possibility that reputation information may be inaccurate.},

Reputation is the accumulative assessment of the long-term behavior, while the risk evaluation is the opinion of the short-term behavior. The risk part is employed to deal with the dramatic spoiling of peers, which makes PET differ from other trust models that based on the reputation only. This paper contributes to first modeling the risk as the opinion of short-term trustworthiness and combining with traditional reputation evaluation to derive the trustworthiness in this field.},

Slices are automatically provisioned by SDN orchestration of network resources, allowing selection of encrypted links as appropriate, including those that use encryption with standard Diffie–Hellman key exchange, QKD, or quantum-resistant algorithms, as well as no encryption at all.

	abstract = {Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is one of the major cryptographic solutions to tackle the security threats associated to future computational advances, in particular those coming from quantum computing. At the most simple level, QKD can be seen as a highly secure source of symmetric secret keys in two separated places. Nonetheless, the lack of standardization and the strong requirements from the physical layer makes this technology very difficult to integrate in existing infrastructure.However, the success of QKD networks radically depends on the degree in which they can be adopted in the existing infrastructure, and it is a must that it happens via standard protocols and interfaces. The flexibility of novel network paradigms, like Software-Defined Networking (SDN), allows for a faster adoption of new concepts, hardware and services in telecommunications networks. This paradigm can be used for quantum communications, allowing for a fast and scalable deployment of quantum technologies and services in the telecommunications network to a degree that was simply impossible in previous schemes, where the different network devices and their connections should be modified, one by one, to create a quantum communications channel.This tutorial provides an introduction to existing QKD technologies and networks, followed by a descriptive explanation on how SDN principles can be utilized to abstract and integrate QKD systems as part of the network management. This will help to reduce the time-to-market for quantum technologies, and also will make quantum cryptography available as a service to be capitalized by the network operators.},

	abstract = {Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is one of the major cryptographic solutions to tackle the security threats associated to future computational advances, in particular those coming from quantum computing. At the most simple level, QKD can be seen as a highly secure source of symmetric secret keys in two separated places. Nonetheless, the lack of standardization and the strong requirements from the physical layer makes this technology very difficult to integrate in existing infrastructure.However, the success of QKD networks radically depends on the degree in which they can be adopted in the existing infrastructure, and it is a must that it happens via standard protocols and interfaces. The flexibility of novel network paradigms, like Software-Defined Networking (SDN), allows for a faster adoption of new concepts, hardware and services in telecommunications networks. This paradigm can be used for quantum communications, allowing for a fast and scalable deployment of quantum technologies and services in the telecommunications network to a degree that was simply impossible in previous schemes, where the different network devices and their connections should be modified, one by one, to create a quantum communications channel.This tutorial provides an introduction to existing QKD technologies and networks, followed by a descriptive explanation on how SDN principles can be utilized to abstract and integrate QKD systems as part of the network management. This will help to reduce the time-to-market for quantum technologies, and also will make quantum cryptography available as a service to be capitalized by the network operators.},

	abstract = {There is a great attention to quantum technologies in the ICT environment. In particular, when dealing with security matters, the most prominent quantum technology is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). QKD allows the sharing of symmetric keys with information theoretic security (ITS, i.e. independently of the computational power of the attacker) between two remote network nodes. QKD is the only known method to share a key able to reach ITS. During the last two decades, there has been a tremendous technological progress in QKD research, that has led to the availability of QKD network demonstrators.Software Defined Networks (SDN) enables the automation of service provisioning within network operator infrastructures. With the advent of web-scale services and dynamic network requirements, operators can not anymore deploy their services based on manual intervention or using proprietary vendor solutions. Programmability is key in the next-generation network infrastructure and any new technology must be integrated with this paradigm. Let us highlight that this requirement is even more important with virtual environments, where a Virtual Network Function (VNF) can be deployed in any point-of-presence of the operator. The new 5G deployments will enable operators to have edge computing services supporting different capabilities, thus increasing even more the complexity to deliver services without any automation.In spite of the high potential of QKD, this technology has not yet found its path to wide adoption, commercialization and deployment. QKD is a physical technology that requires the existence of a quantum channel, a physical connection able to transmit quantum bits without perturbation, making hard its integration in networks. The aim of this document is to present how QKD can be deployed in next generation infrastructures, based on realistic scenarios. To do so, this paper describes the technological components of the solutions, as well as the use cases that motivate such effort. These use cases are described from a telecommunication provider's point of view, as they are the actors in charge of deploying QKD systems in their networks.},

	abstract = {Auditing is a crucial component of network security practices in organizations with sensitive information, such as banks and hospitals. Unfortunately, network function virtualization (NFV) is viewed as incompatible with auditing practices which verify that security functions operate correctly. In this paper, we bring the beneﬁts of NFV to security-sensitive environments with the design and implementation of AuditBox. AuditBox not only makes NFV compatible with auditing, but also provides stronger guarantees than traditional auditing procedures. In traditional auditing, administrators test the system for correctness on a schedule, e.g., once per month. In contrast, AuditBox continuously self-monitors for correct behavior, proving runtime guarantees that the system remains in compliance with policy goals. Furthermore, AuditBox remains compatible with traditional auditing practices by providing sampled logs which still allow auditors to inspect system behavior manually. AuditBox achieves its goals by combining trusted execution environments with a lightweight veriﬁed routing protocol (VRP). Despite the complexity of routing policies for service-function chains relative to traditional routing, AuditBox’s protocol introduces 72-80\% fewer bytes of overhead per packet (in a 5-hop service chain) and provides 61-67\% higher goodput than prior work on VRPs designed for the Internet.},

The separation brings about flexibility, automation, orchestration and offers savings in both capital and operational expenditure.

One of the key threat to SDN is the authentication and authorisation of network applications that control network behaviour (unlike the traditional network where network devices like routers and switches are autonomous and run proprietary software and protocols to control the network). This paper proposes a mechanism that helps the control layer authenticate network applications and set authorisation permissions that constrict manipulation of network resources.},

	abstract = {Software Defined Networks (SDNs) is a new network paradigm and is gaining significant attention in recent years. However, security remains a great challenge, though several improvements have been proposed. A key security challenge is the lack of trust between the SDN controller and the applications running atop the control plane. SDN controller can easily be attacked if these applications are malicious or compromised by an attacker to control the entire network or even result in network failure since it represents a single point of failure in the SDN. Though trust mechanisms to verify network devices exist, mechanisms to verify management applications are still not well developed. Therefore, this paper proposes a unique direct trust establishment framework between an OpenFlow-based SDN controller and the applications. The objective is to ensure that SDN controller is protected and multitude of applications that regularly consume network resources are always trusted throughout their lifetime. Additionally, the paper introduced the concept of trust access matrix and application identity to ensure efficient control of network resources. Based on its operation, if this proposed trust model is adopted in the OpenFlow architecture, it could go a long way to improve the security of the SDN and protect the controller.},

SDN is also of particular interest for NFV which deals with the virtualization of network functions. The network programmability offered by SDN presents then various advantages but it also induces various threats regarding potential attacks on the network. For instance, there is a critical risk that a hacker takes over the network control by exploiting this SDN network programmability (e.g., using the SDN API or tampering a network application running on the SDN controller). This paper proposes then an approach to deal with this possible lack of trust in the SDN controller or in their applications. This approach consists in not relying on a single controller but on several ‘redundant’ controllers that may also run in different execution environments. The network configuration requests coming from these controllers are then compared and, if deemed sufficiently consistent and then trustable, they are actually sent to the network. This approach has been implemented in an intermediary layer (based on a network hypervisor) inserted between the network equipments and the controllers. Experimentations have been performed showing the feasibility of the approach and providing some first evaluations of its impact on the network and the services.},

	abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) provides great flexibility by decoupling the control and the data planes, allowing for the implementation of new and innovative network control plane experiments. Presently, the reference implementation for SDN architecture is reliant upon a single controller to push flow rules to all SDN-enabled switches in the network, creating a performance bottleneck and single-point of failure in large networks. To provide a scalable yet efficient solution to distributed SDN network management, we propose FlowBroker, a hierarchical brokering agent layer which manages and coordinates among distributed SDN controllers, where each controller is charged with the flow-rule maintenance of the switches in its managed domain. This paper proposes the FlowBroker architecture as a collaborative multi-domain approach to load balancing and network performance enhancement in software-defined networks. Moreover, we introduce distributed machine learning agents to allow controllers to evaluate which brokers are more advantageous than others, from a performance-based reputation perspective. Simulation results show that the FlowBroker architecture, with broker-based collaborative load-balancing and controller-based distributed reputation, can significantly increase the network performance of a multi-domain software-defined network. FlowBroker yields significant reductions in traffic loss, end-to-end delay and maximum link utilization when cooperative brokering and reputation are utilized.},

In this system, vehicles can validate the received messages from neighboring vehicles using Bayesian Inference Model. Based on the validation result, the vehicle will generate a rating for each message source vehicle. With the ratings uploaded from vehicles, roadside units (RSUs) calculate the trust value offsets of involved vehicles and pack these data into a “block.” Then, each RSU will try to add their “blocks” to the trust blockchain which is maintained by all the RSUs. By employing the joint proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the more total value of offsets (stake) is in the block, the easier RSU can find the nonce for the hash function (PoW). In this way, all RSUs collaboratively maintain an updated, reliable, and consistent trust blockchain.

Within the problem's scope, we have analyzed the traffic engineering (TE), quality of service (QoS) provisioning, network stability, and failure recovery issues. The proposed solution aims to optimize the network throughput subject to multiple QoS constraints and link-failure robustness constraints that are defined in service level agreements (SLAs), while minimizing the time-average rate of routing updates according to ISP preferences. In contrast to the conventional TE mechanisms which periodically optimize all the routing rules, our solution is based on a bi-objective optimization model which jointly optimizes the routing and the number of flow-table updates. In this way, the reconfiguration overhead of TE is reduced, thus the SDN controller could perform TE more frequently, in order to quickly and efficiently respond to traffic and topology changes. To generate a set of Pareto optimal solutions for the proposed optimization model we use the augmented \${\textbackslash}epsilon \$ -constrained method. The most efficient trade-off solution from the Pareto set is chosen by the Lypunov drift-plus-penalty algorithm. In order to make the proposed approach scalable enough for large network topologies, we also propose a heuristic TE algorithm that runs in polynomial time. The proposed solution is validated via simulations and experimentally, and it is shown that it outperforms conventional periodic TE techniques. The advantages of our proposal over a state-of-the-art TE technique in terms of the capability to adjust the reconfiguration rate based on the threshold set by ISP is demonstrated. In the analysis, a special attention is paid to the impact of proactive failure protection mechanisms on the network service capacity.},

In this paper, the reference architecture, functionality, closed-loop control, enabling algorithms of the network intelligence are presented. An intelligent 5G test-bed is set up and the experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness.},

As a result, it provides a consolidated view of the architectural efforts developed in the projects part of the 5G PPP initiative and other research efforts, including standardization. This effort serves not only to review the current state of the art, but also to identify promising trends towards the next generation of mobile and wireless communication networks, namely, 6G. This is the fourth release of this white paper, whose beginning dates back to July 2016, when the first version was released. Since then, this effort continuously captured the technology trends as developed by the different phases of 5G PPP projects: the first phase (Phase I), that laid the foundation of the network slicing-aware operation we are seeing these days; the second one (Phase II) which provided the first proof of concepts; and the third one (Phase III) that has targeted the first large scale platforms. All these efforts were captured in the subsequent releases of the white paper (version 2 in January 2018 and version 3 in February 2020). This current version 4 of the white paper is hence focusing on the output of the Phase III projects, thus, discussing the latest findings in terms of the integration of large infrastructure and vertical industries, also known as verticals, the long-term evolution of the 5G technologies and the service-specific features. The view consolidated in this white paper presents the current overview on the 5G Architecture as developed by European research efforts.},

The design of the Cloud4SOA solution, extensively presented in this work, comprises of a set of interlinked collaborating software components and models to provide developers and platform providers with a number of core capabilities: matchmaking, management, monitoring and migration of applications.

	abstract = {Technological evolution of mobile user equipment (TIEs), such as smartphones or laptops, goes hand-in-hand with evolution of new mobile applications. However, running computationally demanding applications at the TIEs is constrained by limited battery capacity and energy consumption of the TIEs. A suitable solution extending the battery life-time of the TIEs is to offload the applications demanding huge processing to a conventional centralized cloud. Nevertheless, this option introduces significant execution delay consisting of delivery of the off loaded applications to the cloud and back plus time of the computation at the cloud. Such a delay is inconvenient and makes the offloading unsuitable for real-time applications. To cope with the delay problem, a new emerging concept, known as mobile edge computing (MEC), has been introduced. The MEC brings computation and storage resources to the edge of mobile network enabling it to run the highly demanding applications at the TIE while meeting strict delay requirements. The MEC computing resources can be exploited also by operators and third parties for specific purposes. In this paper, we first describe major use cases and reference scenarios where the MEC is applicable. After that we survey existing concepts integrating MEC functionalities to the mobile networks and discuss current advancement in standardization of the MEC. The core of this survey is, then, focused on user-oriented use case in the MEC, i.e., computation offloading. In this regard, we divide the research on computation offloading to three key areas: 1) decision on computation offloading; 2) allocation of computing resource within the MEC; and 3) mobility management. Finally, we highlight lessons learned in area of the MEC and we discuss open research challenges yet to be addressed in order to fully enjoy potentials offered by the MEC.},

Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks. 5G wireless systems, with improved data rates, capacity, latency, and QoS are expected to be the panacea of most of the current cellular networks' problems. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution toward 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the radio access network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in-depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms, and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE, and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency. As understanding the current status of 5G implementation is important for its eventual commercialization, we also discuss relevant field trials, drive tests, and simulation experiments. Finally, we point out major existing research issues and identify possible future research directions.},

However, it cannot make recommendations for so-called cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In addition, these methods do not know how confident they are in their recommendations. Trust-based recommendation methods assume the additional knowledge of a trust network among users and can better deal with cold start users, since users only need to be simply connected to the trust network. On the other hand, the sparsity of the user item ratings forces the trust-based approach to consider ratings of indirect neighbors that are only weakly trusted, which may decrease its precision. In order to find a good trade-off, we propose a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach for recommendation. The random walk model allows us to define and to measure the confidence of a recommendation. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset and compared our model with existing trust-based and collaborative filtering methods.},

This approach is based on finding the most relevant k users from whose rating history we can extract items to recommend. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network, which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people they trust. In our work, we explore the use of regular equivalence applied to a trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used to select the k-nearest neighbors for recommending items. We evaluate our approach on Epinions and we find that we can outperform related methods for tackling cold-start users in terms of recommendation accuracy.},

One of the fundamental challenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities and develop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to a system by malicious nodes. In this paper, we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralized reputation management and propose TrustGuard - a safeguard framework for providing a highly dependable and yet efficient reputation system. First, we provide a dependable trust model and a set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuously change their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system. Second, a transaction based reputation system must cope with the vulnerability that malicious nodes may misuse the system by flooding feedbacks with fake transactions. Third, but not least, we identify the importance of filtering out dishonest feedbacks when computing reputation-based trust of a node, including the feedbacks filed by malicious nodes through collusion. Our experiments show that, comparing with existing reputation systems, our framework is highly dependable and effective in countering malicious nodes regarding strategic oscillating behavior, flooding malevolent feedbacks with fake transactions, and dishonest feedbacks.},

Having reliable reputation information about peers can form the basis of an incentive system and can guide peers in their decision making (e.g., who to download a file from). The reputation system uses objective criteria to track each peer's contribution in the system and allows peers to store their reputations locally. Reputation are computed using either of the two schemes, debit-credit reputation computation (DCRC) and credit-only reputation computation (CORC). Using a reputation computation agent (RCA), we design a public key based mechanism that periodically updates the peer reputations in a secure, light-weight, and partially distributed manner. We evaluate using simulations the performance tradeoffs inherent in the design of our system.},

	abstract = {With the advent of revolutionary technologies, such as virtualization and softwarization, a novel concept for 5G networks and beyond has been unveiled: Network Slicing. Initially driven by the research community, standardization bodies as 3GPP have embraced it as a promising solution to revolutionize the traditional mobile telecommunication market by enabling new business models opportunities. Network Slicing is envisioned to open up the telecom market to new players such as Industry Verticals, e.g., automotive, smart factories, e-health, etc. Given the large number of potential new business players, dubbed as network tenants, novel solutions are required to accommodate their needs in a cost-efficient and secure manner. In this paper, we propose NSBchain, a novel network slicing brokering (NSB) solution, which leverages on the widely adopted Blockchain technology to address the new business models needs beyond traditional network sharing agreements. NSBchain defines a new entity, the Intermediate Broker (IB), which enables Infrastructure Providers (InPs) to allocate network resources to IBs through smart contracts and IBs to assign and re-distribute their resources among tenants in a secure, automated and scalable manner. We conducted an extensive performance evaluation by means of an open-source blockchain platform that proves the feasibility of our proposed framework considering a large number of tenants and two different consensus algorithms.},

This implies that heterogeneous service level agreements (SLAs) must be guaranteed per slice given the multitude of predefined requirements. In this paper, we pioneer a novel radio slicing orchestration solution that simultaneously provides latency and throughput guarantees in a multi-tenancy environment. Leveraging on a solid mathematical framework, we exploit the exploration-vs-exploitation paradigm by means of a multi-armed-bandit-based (MAB) orchestrator, LACO, that makes adaptive resource slicing decisions with no prior knowledge on the traffic demand or channel quality statistics. As opposed to traditional MAB methods that are blind to the underlying system, LACO relies on system structure information to expedite decisions. After a preliminary simulations campaign empirically proving the validness of our solution, we provide a robust implementation of LACO using off-the-shelf equipment to fully emulate realistic network conditions: near-optimal results within affordable computational time are measured when LACO is in place.},

	abstract = {Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) exploits Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to efficiently and dynamically orchestrate different Service Function Chaining (SFC), whereby reducing capital expenditure and operation expenses. The SFC is an optimization problem that shall consider different constraints, such as Quality of Service (QoS), and actual resources, to achieve cost-efficient scheduling and allocation of the service functions. However, the large-scale, complexity and security issues brought by virtualized IoT networks, which embrace different network segments, e.g. Fog, Edge, Core, Cloud, that can also exploit proximity (computation offloading of virtualized IoT functions to the Edge), imposes new challenges for ZSM orchestrators intended to optimize the SFC, thereby achieving seamless user-experience, minimal end-to-end delay at a minimal cost. To cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-efficient optimized orchestration system that addresses the whole life-cycle management of different SFCs, that considers QoS (including end-to-end delay, bandwidth, jitters), actual capacities of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), potentially deployed across multiple Clouds-Edges, in terms of resources (CPU, RAM, storage) and current network security levels to ensure trusted deployments. The proposed orchestration system has been implemented and evaluated in the scope of H2020 Anastacia EU project\${\textasciicircum}1\$, showing its feasibility and performance to efficiently manage SFC, optimizing deployment costs, reducing overall end-to-end delay and optimizing VNF instances distribution.},

This paper concentrates on reducing the operating expenditure (OPEX) costs while i) increasing the quality of service (QoS) by leveraging the benefits of queuing and multi-path forwarding in OpenFlow, ii) allowing an operator with an SDN-enabled network to efficiently allocate the network resources considering mobility, and iii) reducing or even eliminating the need for over-provisioning. For achieving these objectives, a QoS aware network configuration and multipath forwarding approach is introduced that efficiently manages the operation of SDN enabled open virtual switches (OVSs). This paper proposes and evaluates three solutions that exploit the strength of QoS aware routing using multiple paths. While the two first solutions provide optimal and approximate optimal configurations, respectively, using linear integer programming optimization, the third one is a heuristic that uses Dijkstra short-path algorithm.

	abstract = {Besides significantly outperforming past generations in terms of capacity and throughput, 5G networks and systems will provide an infrastructure for the support of highly diversified services and “verticals”. Indeed, the major paradigm shift with respect to previous cellular network generations, specifically oriented to one class of terminals (namely, people’s cell phones), is the largely heterogeneous nature of the multiplicity of end systems supported. Within a 5G infrastructure, playing the role of “network of networks”, traditionally independent technical and business stakeholders are now called to cooperate in the deployment of crucial infrastructure components relying on innovative (for the Telecom world) technologies such as virtualization, not in the traditional operators’ portfolio, and eventually placed in security-critical parts of the network — think e.g. to Multi Access Edge Computing systems. Goal of this survey is to analyze the complex threat landscape of 5G systems, by taking the point of view of the involved stakeholders. The motivation behind our proposed analysis revolves on the observation that, in complex and virtualized systems such as the 5G infrastructure, an attack to a system component under the responsibility of a given stakeholder may yield a dramatic impact to a completely different player. Therefore, while reviewing the many 5G security risks and relevant threats which the main stakeholders operating in virtualized 5G cellular networks are exposed to, we will try to showcase the sometimes non-obvious relation between impact and responsibility, as well as identify shared responsibilities.},

Nevertheless, it poses several challenges in both resource provisioning and management that need to be addressed for the efficient end-to-end service delivery. In particular, network slice deployments considering operation across several domains and network segments, require of inter-domain configurations, continuous monitoring, potential actuations, inter-slice isolation, among other, in order to be provisioned and maintained, looking forward to guaranteeing their assured Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In such scenario, optical networks are of prime importance, enabling the inter-connectivity between multiple far away segments and Points of Presence (PoPs). In light of this, in this paper we present an architecture design enabling network slice provisioning for 5G service chaining in multi-segment/multi-domain optical network scenarios. The presented design is enriched with a policy-based monitoring and actuation framework able to maintain the desired QoS for the provisioned end-to-end (E2E) network slice. We experimentally validated the proposal against real slice deployments and traffic generation, providing a proof of concept for the presented architecture, with special emphasis in the demonstration of the actuation framework as a key element for quality guarantees.},

In this article, we propose a novel QoS framework of NS in 5G and beyond networks based on SDN and NFV to guarantee key QoS indicators for different application scenarios, such as eMBB, mMTC and URLLC. In this QoS framework, a 5G network is divided into three parts, RAN, TN and CN, to form three types of NS with different network resource allocation algorithms. The performance evaluation in the simulation environment of Mininet shows that the proposed QoS framework can steer different flows into different queues of OVS, schedule network resources for various NS types and provide reliable E2E QoS for users according to preconfigured QoS requirements.},

	title = {Trust-aware {Life}-cycle {Management} of {Federated} {Edge} {Clouds}},
	abstract = {In the 5G and IoT era, service delivery and management models become more and more complex, by combining a wide variety of technologies and devices. The complexity of the new service delivery models raises new challenges for the fulfilment and management of the service life-cycle, from service discovery and selection, to orchestration, management and monitoring. In addition, in such context, where unknown users, devices and providers need to interact to achieve service fulfillment, it is critical to provide a sense of trust between users. The motivation for this dissertation is to tackle the new challenges arising in the service life-cycle management and enable trust in such scenarios. In the first part of this dissertation, our main focus is to assess services over heterogeneous resources, considering Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) by combining monitoring data, the subjective perception of various users and their unique requirements. To achieve this, we aim to quantify the service assessment with the above criteria, as a reputation score value, that represents the performance and reliability of the service in a fair manner, while guaranteeing protection from malicious actors trying to manipulate it. This value can enable trust towards service providers while assisting users in the service selection process taking into account their unique priorities. To achieve the aforementioned goals, we developed collaborative Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Reputation Trust Management (RTM) frameworks with focus on cloud federations. Cloud Federation is the deployment, management and collaboration of several cloud computing services. It can integrate private, community, and public clouds providing multiple benefits such as scalability, fault tolerance and elasticity to the cloud environment while raising new challenges, namely interoperability issues of heterogeneous clouds and lack of trust among different providers. In this environment, we use SLA, in order to allow users to enforce guarantees about the performance of consumed services. We extend Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) assessed by the SLAs to surpass the limited availability KPI provided by most cloud and service providers at the moment, towards better addressing the specific requirements of each user.Furthermore, for the RTM aspect of our collaborative framework, we focus on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for the quantification of trust and the computation of the reputation values. We adopt MCDM methodologies due to their capability of receiving as input multiple KPIs combining QoS and QoE metrics. In our research work, we modified and extended two known scalable fuzzy-based MCDM techniques, namely Fuzzy VIKOR and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP). The first one is horizontal while the latter one is a hierarchical MCDM system. The key contributions of our extensions in those systems mainly refer to their capability of facilitating inputs, not only limited to fuzzy numbers, but also to include linguistic and binary values. In this way, we can combine a wide variety of QoS and QoE aspects in the computation of the reputation score value, guaranteeing that a high reputation value represents wholesomely the provider's performance and reliability. We also modified those techniques to allow users to provide custom weights in the evaluation process to express different requirements.Last but not least, we introduce in both approaches credibility mechanisms that compare the user's evaluation with SLA and monitoring measurements in order to detect malicious actors and protect providers from reputation score manipulation attempts.The implementation and experimental validation and assessment of our novel solutions validated the effectiveness of our SLA techniques and the performance of our proposed RTM solutions. In particular, in comparison with other known frameworks in the literature, our proposed approaches highlighted the importance of mixing several numerical and fuzzy metrics, in contrast to adopting numeric only input, as well as the necessity and effectiveness of our introduced credibility mechanisms.On the second part of the thesis, we address challenges in the service life-cycle management. Our main focus is to facilitate the life-cycle management of services in a multi-domain federated Edge Cloud environment and enable tenants to either offer services for off-the-shelf leasing or lease a service that suits their needs. Federated edge clouds in the scope of this dissertation, refer to multi-administrative collaboration of multiple providers willing to allow cross-domain communication to allow off-the-self leasing of services developed by either providers or tenants through an Network Service Marketplace (NSM). In order to fulfill the above objectives, we shift from trust management frameworks to trustless systems to assist the life-cycle management of services in this context. We use blockchain as our trustless system, as it enables parties without trust between them, to interact without a central trusted authority, communicating in a decentralized fashion, maintaining the same functionality, while all parties can retain the certainty for the outcome of the transactions. We used blockchain technology to develop a fully functional NSM for off-the-self service leasing. We utilize blockchain's distributed ledger as a distributed database between different providers and edge clouds, and we leverage smart contracts to enable the platform and the transactions. Using smart contracts we developed all the necessary interactions and transactions required in an NSM facilitating all steps in a service's life-cycle such as service discovery, selection, leasing, billing and most importantly resource orchestration. We provide a multi-domain architecture aligned with the ETSI-NFV standards, which is highly scalable and requires minimum resource and management and development overheads for new Edge Cloud providers.Furthermore, in order to fulfill the consumption of a leased service in the NSM we developed a novel Cross-Service Communication (CSC) orchestrator over Network Function Virtualization (NFV) reference architecture. Our orchestrator, assisted with the minimum information required for the operation by our blockchain-based NSM, offers the necessary abstractions and operations for an automated and seamless CSC orchestration. The data stored in the blockchain are the minimum required and contain mostly tags guaranteeing both data efficiency and data privacy regarding the services offered. The implementation and evaluation of our NSM and orchestrator validated that our proposed solution is highly scalable, and the orchestration time overheads added from blockchain, API and orchestrator interactions are negligible. In addition, the Cross-Communication orchestration requires no extra resources, while other proposals in the literature require intermediary services to function.Finally, we summarize the conclusions of our thesis and offer interesting ideas for future development and enrichment of our work, along with significant synergies that can occur between the different solutions presented in this dissertation.},

	abstract = {The quality of a reputation system depends on the integrity of the ratings it receives as input. A fundamental problem is that a rater can rate an agent more positively or more negatively than the real experience with the agent would dictate. When ratings are provided by agents outside the control of the relying party, it is a priori impossible to know when a rater provides such unfair ratings. However, it is often the case that unfair ratings have a different statistical pattern than fair ratings. This paper uses that idea, and describes a statistical filtering technique for excluding unfair ratings, and illustrates its effectiveness through simulations.},

	abstract = {Friend based Ad hoc routing using Challenges to Establish Security (FACES) is an algorithm to provide secure routing in ad hoc mobile networks. We propose this scheme that has been drawn from a network of friends in real life scenarios. The algorithm works by sending challenges and sharing friend Lists to provide a list of trusted nodes to the source node through which data transmission finally takes place. The nodes in the friend list are rated on the basis of the amount of data transmission they accomplish and their friendship with other nodes in the network. The account of friendship of a node with other nodes in the network is obtained through the Share Your Friends process which is a periodic event in the network. As a result of this scheme of operation, the network is able to effectively isolate the malicious nodes which are left with no role to play in the ad hoc network. One major benefit of this scheme is that the nodes do not need to promiscuously listen to the traffic passing through their neighbors. The information about the malicious nodes is gathered effectively by using Challenges. This reduces the overhead on the network significantly. Through extensive simulation analysis it was inferred that this scheme provides an efficient approach towards security and easier detection of malicious nodes in the mobile ad hoc network.},

To overcome such complexity, future 5G networks must employ a very high degree of network and service management automation, which is a security challenge by itself as well as an opportunity for smarter and more efficient security functions. In this paper, we present the smart, trustworthy and liable 5G security platform being designed and developed in the INSPIRE-5Gplus1 project. This platform takes advantage of new techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), network softwarization and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for closed-loop and end-to-end security management following a zero-touch model in 5G and Beyond 5G networks. To this end, we specifically elaborate on two key aspects of our platform, namely security management with Security Service Level Agreements (SSLAs) and liability management, in addition to the description of the overall architecture.},

	abstract = {With the expansion of 5G networks, new business models are arising where multi-tenancy and active infrastructure sharing will be key enablers for them. With these new opportunities, new security risks are appearing in the form of a complex and evolving threat landscape for 5G networks, being one of the main challenges for the 5G mass rollout. In 5G-enabled scenarios, adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities associated with resource sharing to perform lateral movements targeting other tenant resources, as well as to disturb the 5G services offered or even the infrastructure resources. Moreover, existing security and trust models are not adequate to react to the dynamicity of the 5G infrastructure threats nor to the multi-tenancy security risks. Hence, we propose in this work a new security and trust framework for 5G multi-domain scenarios. To motivate its application, we detail a threat model covering multi-tenant scenarios in an underlying 5G network infrastructure. We also propose different ways to mitigate these threats by increasing the security and trust levels using network security monitoring, threat investigation, and end-to-end trust establishments. The framework is applied in a realistic use case of the H2020 5GZORRO project, which envisions a multi-tenant environment where domain owners share resources at will. The proposed framework forms a secure environment with zero-touch automation capabilities, minimizing human intervention.},

In this paper, we design and validate a dynamic trust management protocol for secure routing optimization in DTN environments in the presence of well-behaved, selfish and malicious nodes. We develop a novel model-based methodology for the analysis of our trust protocol and validate it via extensive simulation. Moreover, we address dynamic trust management, i.e., determining and applying the best operational settings at runtime in response to dynamically changing network conditions to minimize trust bias and to maximize the routing application performance. We perform a comparative analysis of our proposed routing protocol against Bayesian trust-based and non-trust based (PROPHET and epidemic) routing protocols. The results demonstrate that our protocol is able to deal with selfish behaviors and is resilient against trust-related attacks. Furthermore, our trust-based routing protocol can effectively trade off message overhead and message delay for a significant gain in delivery ratio. Our trust-based routing protocol operating under identified best settings outperforms Bayesian trust-based routing and PROPHET, and approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message or protocol maintenance overhead.},

In current Internet practices, choices of interconnection partners are driven by factors such as word of mouth, personal relationships, brand recognition and market intelligence, and not by proofs of previous performance. Given that Internet eXchange Points provide increasingly more peering choices, rudimentary schemes for picking interconnection partners are not adequate anymore. Although the current interconnection ecosystem is shrouded in confidentiality, our key observation is that recently-emerged blockchain technology and advances in cryptography enable a privacy-preserving decentralized solution based on actual performance measurements. We propose the concept of SLA score to evaluate network providers and introduce a privacy-preserving protocol that allows networks to compute and verify SLA scores.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in today’s Internet introduced huge demand for End-to-End Quality of Service (E2E QoS) assurances for delivering different types of traffic (video, live streaming, and telemedicine), originating from a wide spectrum of applications. Such applications stretch across multiple administrative domains and require fair and robust coordination for E2E QoS provisioning. While the selection of trusted domains is of paramount importance for the successful realization of E2E QoS, the issue of domain’s trust while finding E2E QoS paths has not been actively explored in the existing works. Trust awareness reduces the risk of violating QoS and improves the confidence of operating QoS across multiple domains. However, identifying trusted domains, finding the source of trust, and quantifying trust are the major challenges for enabling trust aware E2E QoS routing. Auditability of QoS implementation results at each domain forms a vital source for verifying QoS compliance and subsequently evaluating the trust of the domain. However, securely obtaining logs from the domains and identifying the accountability of domains for E2E QoS, without relying on a third party introduces significant difficulty when evaluating domain trust with respect to QoS compliance. This work proposes Trust aware E2E QoS Routing (TRAQR) framework for provisioning E2E QoS with trust and verifying the QoS compliance in Multi-Domain Software Defined Networks (MD-SDN). TRAQR efficiently leverages the tamper-proof and decentralized properties of Blockchain to store and exchange different kinds of trust information required to provision and verify E2E QoS compliance of the domains. This work developed a proof of concept implementation of the TRAQR in an MD-SDN environment emulated using Mininet, RYU SDN controller, Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to demonstrate the performance and benefits of TRAQR. Further, the simulations showed that the domain trust parameter introduced significant improvement in QoS compliance, even in the presence of untrusted domains.},

These models have offered great opportunities to improve IT industries and business processes through the convergence of cloud computing and internet of things (IoT). Although this convergence establishes seamless intelligent interaction among physical and virtual entities, it has difficulty not only to meet the required level of quality of service(QoS) but also to satisfy the user’s complex demands. As a result, the predisposition to create a dynamic service-oriented environment has become a fundamental design issue. The main objective of this study is to introduce a dynamic QoS provisioning framework (QoPF) for service-oriented IoT using backtracking search optimization algorithm (BSOA). The QoPF framework is proposed to maximize the composite service quality in IoT application layer by making a balance between service reliability and acceptable cost of the computational time. The effectiveness of the QoPF framework is evaluated using a number of performance metrics such as throughput, delay time, and jitter. The experimental results demonstrate that worthiness of the QoPF to meet QoS requirements more than other state-of-the-art techniques in the literature review.},

However, we argue that the conventional view of security based on cryptography alone is not sufficient for the unique characteristics and novel misbehaviors encountered in sensor networks. Fundamental to this is the observation that cryptography cannot prevent malicious or non-malicious insertion of data from internal adversaries or faulty nodes. We believe that in general tools from different domains such as economics, statistics and data analysis will have to be combined with cryptography for the development of trustworthy sensor networks. Following this approach, we propose a reputation-based framework for sensor networks where nodes maintain reputation for other nodes and use it to evaluate their trustworthiness. We will show that this framework provides a scalable, diverse and a generalized approach for countering all types of misbehavior resulting from malicious and faulty nodes. We are currently developing a system within this framework where we employ a Bayesian formulation, specifically a beta reputation system, for reputation representation, updates and integration. We will explain the reasoning behind our design choices, analyzing their pros \& cons. We conclude the paper by verifying the efficacy of this system through some preliminary simulation results.},

Within this scenario, we focus on the problem of understanding how the information provided by members of the social IoT has to be processed so as to build a reliable system on the basis of the behavior of the objects. We define two models for trustworthiness management starting from the solutions proposed for P2P and social networks. In the subjective model each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own experience and on the opinion of the friends in common with the potential service providers. In the objective model, the information about each node is distributed and stored making use of a distributed hash table structure so that any node can make use of the same information. Simulations show how the proposed models can effectively isolate almost any malicious nodes in the network at the expenses of an increase in the network traffic for feedback exchange.},

Further we develop a novel adaptive filtering technique to determine the best way to combine direct trust and indirect trust dynamically to minimize convergence time and trust estimation bias in the presence of malicious nodes performing opportunistic service and collusion attacks. For scalability, we consider a design by which a capacity-limited node only keeps trust information of a subset of nodes of interest and performs minimum computation to update trust.

	abstract = {In this paper we present a case study of IoT cloud participatory sensing where a user sends a query to the cloud about the air quality of a location at a particular time to decide if it should enter the location based on its susceptibility to the air quality detected. All IoT devices (e.g., smart phones carried by humans or smart cars driven by humans) capable of detecting air quality can act as participants and submit sensing reports to the cloud for sensing result aggregation. The major challenge is the selection of trustworthy participants because not all IoT devices will be trustworthy. We leverage a “Trust as a Service” (TaaS) cloud utility to address the issue of selecting trustworthy participants. Using real traces of ozone (O3) levels and mobility traces of users in the O3 community of interest (O3COI) group in the city of Houston, we demonstrate that TaaS outperforms contemporary IoT trust protocols in selecting trustworthy participants. We compare the performance of the TaaS cloud utility with two contemporary IoT trust protocols for supporting trust-based IoT participatory sensing applications. With the help of the TaaS cloud utility, a user in this O3COI group is able to obtain O3 readings very close to the ground truth O3 level despite 30\% participants are untrustworthy.},

	abstract = {—Video traffic, which represents an increasing fraction of the Internet traffic, requires end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees for inter-domain routing. However, providing such guarantees remains a challenge essentially because it requires a strong and fair cooperation among the different network operators or Autonomous Systems (ASes), crossed by the traffic. Having a single AS on the path that does not meet its QoS engagement is sufficient to violate the end-to-end QoS guarantees. Unfortunately, the client is not capable of distinguishing unfair ASes from honest ones at the time it selects its path. Reputation mechanisms turn out to be very efficient tools to estimate how trustworthy and reliable entities can be without requiring the help of any central authority. They are effective to foster cooperation by remedying selfishness. In this position paper, we identify the main properties a reputation mechanism should meet to improve inter-domain QoS routing, and we provide a coarsed-grain vision of the design of such a mechanism.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to trusted grid computing in a peer-to-peer (P2P) setting. Trust and security are essential to establish lasting working relationships among the peers. A P2P reputation system collects peer trust scores and aggregates them to yield a global reputation. We use a new trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among the peers. After analyzing the eBay transaction trace data, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. We develop a new reputation system, PowerTrust, to leverage power-law feedback characteristics. The PowerTrust system is built with locality-preserving hash functions and a lookahead random walk strategy. Dynamic system reconfiguration is enabled by the use of power nodes with well-established reputations. Through P2P simulation experiments on distributed file sharing and grid parameter-sweeping applications (PSA), we demonstrate the PowerTrust advantages in fast reputation convergence and accurate ranking of peer reputations. We report performance results with enhanced P2P query success rate, shortened job makespan, and increased job success rate in scalable P2P grid applications.},

Trust management is a critical component for scaling service provision networks to larger set of participants. This paper presents Service Trust, a quality sensitive and attack resilient trust management facility for service provision networks. Service Trust has three unique features. First, it encapsulates quality-sensitive feedbacks by multi-scale rating scheme and incorporates the variances of user's behaviors into the local trust algorithm. Second, Service Trust measures the similarity of two users' feedback behavior and aggregate the local trust values into the global trust algorithm by exploiting pairwise feedback similarity scores to weight the contributions of local trust values towards the global trust of a participant. Finally, pairwise feedback similarity weighted trust propagation is utilized to further strengthen the robustness of global trust computation against malicious or sparse feedbacks. Experimental evaluation with independent and colluding attack models show that Service Trust is highly resilient to various attacks and highly effective compared to Eigen Trust, one of the most popular and representative trust models to date.},

A number of security studies disclose that reputation management systems are able to be effectual with less overhead. The reputation of a node is calculated by using automated assessment algorithms depend on predefined trust scheme. This paper proposes a Node Activity-based Trust and Reputation estimation (NA-TRE) approach for the security and QoS routing in MANET. NA-TRE aims to find trust estimation and reputation of a node. The NA-TRE approach monitors the activity changes, packet forwarding or dropping in a node to find the status of the node. The various activities of a node like Normal State (NS), Resource Limitation State (RS) and Malicious State (MS) are monitored. This status of a node is helpful in computing trust and reputation. In this paper NA-TRE approach compared with existing protocols AODV, FACE and TMS to evaluate the efficiency of MANET. The experiment results show that 20\% increasing of throughput, 10\% decrease of overhead and end to end delay.},

Although several suggestions exist on how to create a secure key-based routing protocol, a practicable approach is still unattended. In this paper we introduce a secure key-based routing protocol based on Kademlia that has a high resilience against common attacks by using parallel lookups over multiple disjoint paths, limiting free nodeld generation with crypto puzzles and introducing a reliable sibling broadcast. The latter is needed to store data in a safe replicated way. We evaluate the security of our proposed extensions to the Kademlia protocol analytically and simulate the effects of multiple disjoint paths on lookup success under the influence of adversarial nodes.},

One of the system's key goals is to avoid creating hot spots that might dissuade volunteers and hurt performance.

Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing.

We present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values, based on Power iteration. By having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download, the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network.In simulations, this reputation system, called EigenTrust, has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on the network, even under a variety of conditions where malicious peers cooperate in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system.},

Infrastructure Providers (InP) can benefit from an NFV market by providing their infrastructures to fulfill demands of end-users that, in turn, acquire VNFs-as-a-Service (VNFaaS). In this context, solutions that promote the competition between InPs can lead to lower prices, while increasing VNF performance to accommodate specific demands of end-users. In this paper, BRAIN, a blockchain-based reverse auction is presented to introduce an auditable solution in which InPs can compete to host VNFs taking into account the demands of each particular end-user. Such a solution helps reduce costs involved in VNF's commercialization and also monetize NFV-enabled infrastructures. BRAIN is supported by a case study that provides evidence of the solution's feasibility and effectiveness. A discussion regarding blockchain advantages and drawbacks in this use-case (e.g., additional costs and time) concludes this paper.},

By analyzing the lessons from the 4G security system, the requirements from new scenarios and models, the challenges resulting from new technology and paradigm, we identify typical security and privacy issues to be solved in 5G. Then, we discuss potential solutions from academia and industry to secure 5G networks from several perspectives, including the overall 5G security framework, core network, radio access network, cloud infrastructure, and the Internet of things. Finally, several key open issues and potential research directions are identified and discussed.},

Since unintentional temporary errors are possible, the trust management solution must provide a redemption scheme to allow nodes to recover trust. However, if a malicious node tries to disguise its malicious behaviors as unintentional temporary errors, the malicious node may be given more opportunities to attack the system by disturbing the redemption scheme. Existing trust management schemes that employ redemption schemes fail to discriminate between temporary errors and disguised malicious behaviors in which the attacker cleverly behaves well and badly alternatively. In this paper, we present the vulnerabilities of existing redemption schemes, and describe a new trust management and redemption scheme that can discriminate between temporary errors and disguised malicious behaviors with a flexible design. We show the analytical results of the trust management scheme, and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme with simulation conducted in a Wireless Sensor Network.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) reputation systems are essential to evaluate the trustworthiness of participating peers and to combat the selfish, dishonest, and malicious peer behaviors. The system collects locally-generated peer feedbacks and aggregates them to yield the global reputation scores. Surprisingly, most previous work ignored the distribution of peer feedbacks. We use a trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among peers. After examining the eBay transaction trace of over 10,000 users, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. Our mathematical analysis justifies that power-law distribution is applicable to any dynamically growing P2P systems, either structured or unstructured. We develop a robust and scalable P2P reputation system, PowerTrust, to leverage the power-law feedback characteristics. The PowerTrust system dynamically selects small number of power nodes that are most reputable using a distributed ranking mechanism. By using a look-ahead random walk strategy and leveraging the power nodes, PowerTrust significantly improves in global reputation accuracy and aggregation speed. PowerTrust is adaptable to dynamics in peer joining and leaving and robust to disturbance by malicious peers. Through P2P network simulation experiments, we find significant performance gains in using PowerTrust. This power-law guided reputation system design proves to achieve high query success rate in P2P file-sharing applications. The system also reduces the total job makespan and failure rate in large-scale, parameter-sweeping P2P Grid applications.},

	abstract = {Distributed service networks are popular platforms for service providers to offer services to consumers and for service consumers to acquire services from unknown parties. eBay and Amazon are two well-known examples of enabling and hosting such service networks to connect service providers to service consumers. Trust management is a critical component for scaling such distributed service networks to a large and growing number of participants. In this article, we present ServiceTrust++, a feedback quality-sensitive and attack resilient trust management scheme for empowering distributed service networks with effective trust management capability. Compared with existing trust models, ServiceTrust++ has several novel features. First, we present six attack models to capture both independent and colluding attacks with malicious cliques, malicious spies, and malicious camouflages. Second, we aggregate the feedback ratings based on the variances of participants' feedback behaviors and incorporate feedback similarity as weight into the local trust algorithm. Third, we compute the global trust of a participant by employing conditional trust propagation based on the feedback similarity threshold. This allows ServiceTrust++ to control and prevent malicious spies and malicious camouflage peers from boosting their global trust scores by manipulating the feedback ratings of good peers and by taking advantage of the uniform trust propagation. Finally, we systematically combine a trust-decaying strategy with a threshold value-based conditional trust propagation to further strengthen the robustness of our global trust computation against sophisticated malicious feedback. Experimental evaluation with both simulation-based networks and real network dataset Epinion show that ServiceTrust++ is highly resilient against all six attack models and highly effective compared to EigenTrust, the most popular and representative trust propagation model to date.},

	abstract = {As advanced computing and communication technologies penetrate every aspect of our life, we have witnessed the persistent growth of open systems where entities interact with one another without prior knowledge or experiences. Trust becomes an important metric in such open systems. This paper presents a dependable trust management scheme-GroupTrust, and a working system to support GroupTrust. It makes three original contributions. First, we identify a set of vulnerabilities that are common in existing reputation based trust models. We show that reputation trust built solely on direct experiences or by combining direct experiences with uniform trust propagation can be vulnerable. Second, we develop GroupTrust, a dependable trust management scheme to provide reliable trust management in the presence of dishonest ratings, malicious camouflage, and malicious collusive behaviors. The GroupTrust scheme is novel in two aspects: (i) we develop a pairwise similarity based feedback credibility to enhance the resilience of trust computation in the presence of dishonest ratings; (ii) we propose to propagate trust based on a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, which defines trust propagation threshold to control how trust should be propagated. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of GroupTrust against fourthreat models using both simulated and real world datasets. Our experimental results show that feedback credibility based local trust computation can effectively constrain strategically malicious participants from taking advantages of their dishonest ratings. SIR-based trust propagation control enables safe trust propagation and blocks irrational trust propagation. We show that GroupTrust scheme significantly outperforms other trust models in terms of both performance and attack resilience in the presence of dishonest feedbacks, sparse feedbacks, and strategically malicious participants against four representative threat models.},

Thus, trust aggregation becomes critical. It can leverage decentralized trust management to learn about indirect trust of every participant based on past transaction experiences. This article presents alternative designs of decentralized trust management and their efficiency and robustness from three perspectives. First, we study the risk factors and adverse effects of six common threat models. Second, we review the representative trust aggregation models and trust metrics.

We show our comparative study results through formal analysis and experimental evaluation. This comprehensive study advances the understanding of adverse effects of present and future threats and the robustness of different trust metrics. It may also serve as a guideline for research and development of next-generation trust aggregation algorithms and services in the anticipation of risk factors and mischievous threats.},

We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by pools that command less than 1/41/41/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/21/21/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.},

	abstract = {Driven by the emergence of new compute-intensive applications and the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is foreseen that the emerging 5G network will face an unprecedented increase in traffic volume and computation demands. However, end users mostly have limited storage capacities and finite processing capabilities, thus how to run compute-intensive applications on resource-constrained users has recently become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing (MEC), a key technology in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network, can optimize mobile resources by hosting compute-intensive applications, process large data before sending to the cloud, provide the cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware services with the help of RAN information. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications, where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless vehicles, augmented reality, robotics, and immerse media. Indeed, the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G could become a reality with the advent of new technological concepts. The successful realization of MEC in the 5G network is still in its infancy and demands for constant efforts from both academic and industry communities. In this survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC technology and its potential use cases and applications. Then, we outline up-to-date researches on the integration of MEC with the new technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond. We also summarize testbeds and experimental evaluations, and open source activities, for edge computing. We further summarize lessons learned from state-of-the-art research works as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions for MEC research.},

	abstract = {Wireless Virtualization (WiVi) is emerging as a new paradigm to provide high speed communications and meet Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of users while reducing the deployment cost of wireless infrastructure for future wireless networks. In WiVi, Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs) sublease their RF channels through slicing to Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) based on their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the MVNOs independently provide wireless services to their end users. This paper investigates the wireless network virtualization by leveraging both Blockchain technology and machine learning to optimally allocate wireless resources. To eliminate double spending (aka over-committing) of WIPs' wireless resources such as RF channels, Blockchain - a distributed ledger - technology is used where a reputation is used to penalize WIPs with past double spending habit. The proposed reputation based approach helps to minimize extra delay caused by double spending attempts and Blockchain operations. To optimally predict the QoS requirements of MVNOs for their users, linear regression - a machine learning approach - is used that helps to minimize the latency introduced due to (multiple wrong) negotiations for SLAs. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out by using numerical results obtained from simulations. Results have shown that the joint Blockchain and machine learning based approach outperforms the other approaches.},

	abstract = {Wireless network virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization to support exponentially increasing demand caused by emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To create virtual wireless networks (VWNs), there are no automated secure approaches for allocating RF spectrum to meet the dynamically changing quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. In wireless networks, RF spectrum is shared among many users and the given RF spectrum could be easily overcrowded because of the over commitment of limited resources by the service providers. There is a direct incentive in terms of revenue to service providers to have more number of users. In this paper, we propose to leverage a distributed Blockchain - also known as a public ledger - based scheme to create VWNs where primary wireless resource-owners (PWROs) sublease their wireless resources (e.g., slice of RF spectrum, infrastructure) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) using machine-to-machine communication based on the service level agreements (SLAs) between PWROs and MVNOs. The proposed distributed Blockchain-based scheme provides security to participating PWROs and MVNOs as well as prevents PWROs from over committing their resources (that stops double spending) and helps MVNOs to meet the QoS requirements of their users. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or similar regulatory bodies in other countries participate in this framework by providing the guidelines and regulations about maximum power levels, licensing and geographic coverages, etc. This essentially helps users to meet their desired QoS requirements while complying the government regulations. Performance is evaluated using numerical results.},

These applications have heterogeneous performance requirements (e.g., high data rate, low latency, high reliability, and high availability). In order to meet these requirements, 5G networks endorse network flexibility through the deployment of new emerging technologies, mainly network slicing and mobile edge computing. This article introduces a distributed blockchain-enabled network slicing (DBNS) framework that enables service and resource providers to dynamically lease resources to ensure high performance for their end-to-end services. The key component of our framework is the global service provisioning (GSP), which provides admission control for incoming service requests along with dynamic resource assignment by means of a blockchain-based bidding system. The goal is to improve users' experience with diverse services and reduce providers' capital and operational expenditures.},

The future networks are shifting towards the cloudification of the network resources via Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This will equip ISPs with cutting-edge technologies to provide service customization during service delivery and offer QoE which meets customers' needs via intelligent QoE control and management approaches. Towards this end, we provide in this paper a tutorial and a comprehensive survey of QoE management solutions in current and future networks. We start with a high-level description of QoE management for multimedia services, which integrates QoE modelling, monitoring, and optimization. This followed by a discussion of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) solutions as the dominant technique for streaming videos over the best-effort Internet. We then summarize the key elements in SDN/NFV along with an overview of ongoing research projects, standardization activities and use cases related to SDN, NFV, and other emerging applications. We provide a survey of the state-of-the-art of QoE management techniques categorized into three different groups: a) QoE-aware/driven strategies using SDN and/or NFV; b) QoE-aware/driven approaches for adaptive streaming over emerging architectures such as multi-access edge computing, cloud/fog computing, and information-centric networking; and c) extended QoE management approaches in new domains such as immersive augmented and virtual reality, mulsemedia and video gaming applications. Based on the review, we present a list of identified future QoE management challenges regarding emerging multimedia applications, network management and orchestration, network slicing and collaborative service management in softwarized networks.

However, 5G marks a radical shift from this focus as 5G and beyond networks are being designed to be future-proof by catering to diverse requirements of several use cases. These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. To realize such features in 5G and beyond, there is a need to rethink how current cellular networks are deployed because designing new radio access technologies and utilizing the new spectrum are not enough. Several technologies, such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing, are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil the need for diverse requirements. These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues, Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its capabilities such as transparency, data encryption, auditability, immutability and distributed architecture. In this paper, we review the state-of-art application of Blockchain in 5G network and explore how it can facilitate enabling technologies of 5G and beyond to enable various services at the front-haul, edge and the core. Based on the review, we present a taxonomy of Blockchain application in 5G networks and discuss several issues that can be solved using Blockchain integration. We then present various field-trials and Proof of concept that are using Blockchain to address the challenges faced in the current 5G deployment. Finally, we discuss various challenges that need to be addressed to realize the full potential of Blockchain in beyond 5G networks.

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.},

NFV emerges as an initiative from the industry (network operators, carriers, and manufacturers) in order to increase the deployment flexibility and integration of new network services with increased agility within operator's networks and to obtain significant reductions in operating expenditures and capital expenditures. NFV promotes virtualizing network functions such as transcoders, firewalls, and load balancers, among others, which were carried out by specialized hardware devices and migrating them to software-based appliances. One of the main challenges for the deployment of NFV is the resource allocation of demanded network services in NFV-based network infrastructures. This challenge has been called the NFV resource allocation (NFV-RA) problem. This paper presents a comprehensive state of the art of NFV-RA by introducing a novel classification of the main approaches that pose solutions to solve it.

Furthermore, we face information overload, increased uncertainty and risk taking as a prominent feature of modern living. As members of society, we cope with these complexities and uncertainties by relying trust, which is the basis of all social interactions. Although a small number of trust models have been proposed for the virtual medium, we find that they are largely impractical and artificial. In this paper we provide and discuss a trust model that is grounded in real-world social trust characteristics, and based on a reputation mechanism, or word-of-mouth. Our proposed model allows agents to decide which other agents' opinions they trust more and allows agents to progressively tune their understanding of another agent's subjective recommendations.},

The overall orchestration of VNF includes, but is not limited to, processing VNF requests, selecting appropriate VNF, migrating VNF from cloud to MEC, instantiating migrated VNF at MEC, settling payment according to a VNF's usage, maintaining VNF's reputation, etc. The orchestration is not foolproof and raises doubts about its trustworthiness. To address all the existing issues in a unified manner, we leverage Blockchain technology as yet another enabling technology for MEC-enabled 5G. Thus, we propose a Blockchain-enhanced architecture for secure VNF orchestration such that issues like authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, reputation, payment transfer, and many more are resolved. To furnish a Proof-of-Concept (PoC), we develop a prototypical DApp (Decentralized Application) using Ethereum Blockchain and Suricata as an exemplar VNF.

	abstract = {5G services, such as Ultra-reliable and Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband, support low (or ultra-low) latency, a huge number of connections, and high bandwidth. Typically, 5G platforms are shared by multiple tenants, where each tenant has different service deployment requirements and thus requires different amounts of resources from the lower tier (i.e., radio access network and mobile edge) and upper tier (i.e., transport network and central office) of the 5G architecture. Consequently, slicing is a key technology in 5G networks for providing scalability and flexibility in allocating the 5G resources with appropriate isolation. This study proposes an Endto-End Slicing as a Service framework for slicing both computing and communication resources across the full 2-tier multi-access edge computing architecture. The framework is implemented using open source tools. It is shown that the framework successfully isolates the 5G resources, which are computing and communication, between slices (slicing isolation effect ratio equals 1) and ensures that resources of the deployed slices are merely sufficient to meet the latency requirements of the tenants. Moreover, the experiments show that URLLC and mMTC services require more than 70 percent of the needed computing and communication resources be provided by the edge and RAN in order to satisfy their tighter latency requirements. Overall, the results suggest a central to edge resource allocation ratio of 9:1, 3:7, and 1:9 for the eMBB, URLLC, mMTC applications, respectively. Therefore, the resources in the edge and RAN are critical.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been little research on the problem of energy consumption for orchestrating online SFC requests in multi-domain networks. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of an energy-efficient online SFC request that is orchestrated across multiple clouds as an integer linear programming (ILP) model to find an optimal solution. Then, we analyze the complexity of this ILP model and prove that the problem is NP-hard. Additionally, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm named energy-efficient online SFC request orchestration across multiple domains (EE-SFCO-MD) for near-optimally solving the mentioned problem. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Simulation results show that EE-SFCO-MD consumes less energy than existing approaches while the online SFC’s requirements are met and the privacy of each cloud is effectively guaranteed. The low computational complexity of the heuristic approach makes it applicable for quickly responding to online SFC requests.},

	abstract = {Network function (NF) virtualization decouples NFs from the underlying middlebox hardware and promotes their deployment on virtualized network infrastructures. This essentially paves the way for the migration of NFs into clouds (i.e., NF-as-a-Service), achieving a drastic reduction of middlebox investment and operational costs for enterprises. In this context, service chains (expressing middlebox policies in the enterprise network) should be mapped onto datacenter networks, ensuring correctness, resource efficiency, as well as compliance with the provider's policy. The network service embedding (NSE) problem is further exacerbated by two challenging aspects: 1) traffic scaling caused by certain NFs (e.g., caches and WAN optimizers) and 2) NF location dependencies. Traffic scaling requires resource reservations different from the ones specified in the service chain, whereas NF location dependencies, in conjunction with the limited geographic footprint of NF providers (NFPs), raise the need for NSE across multiple NFPs. In this paper, we present a holistic solution to the multi-provider NSE problem. We decompose NSE into: 1) NF-graph partitioning performed by a centralized coordinator and 2) NF-subgraph mapping onto datacenter networks. We present linear programming formulations to derive near-optimal solutions for both problems. We address the challenging aspect of traffic scaling by introducing a new service model that supports demand transformations. We also define topology abstractions for NF-graph partitioning. Furthermore, we discuss the steps required to embed service chains across multiple NFPs, using our NSE orchestrator (Nestor). We perform an evaluation study of multi-provider NSE with emphasis on NF-graph partitioning optimizations tailored to the client and NFPs. Our evaluation results further uncover significant savings in terms of service cost and resource consumption due to the demand transformations.},

The 5G Exchange (5GEx) project, building heavily on the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) functionalities, tries to overcome this market and technology fragmentation by designing, implementing, and testing a multi-domain orchestrator (MdO) prototype for fast and automated Network Service (NS) provisioning over multiple-technologies and spanning across multiple operators. This paper presents a first implementation of the 5GEx MdO prototype obtained by extending existing open source software tools at the disposal of the 5GEx partners. The main functions of the 5GEx MdO prototype are showcased by demonstrating how it is possible to create and deploy NSs in the context of a Slice as a Service (SlaaS) use-case, based on a multi-operator scenario. The 5GEx MdO prototype performance is experimentally evaluated running validation tests within the 5GEx sandbox. The overall time required for the NS deployment has been evaluated considering NSs deployed across two operators.},

In addition, for realizing auto-adjusted service provision, this article designs a dynamic hierarchical SFC orchestration algorithm (DHSOA) based on DRL to minimize the orchestration cost and improve the quality of service. Moreover, considering the dynamics of network entities, this article proposes a time-slotted model to support dynamic service migration which adapts to the high-mobility IoT network.

The industry and the academia are embracing 5G as the future network capable to support next generation vertical applications with different service requirements. To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.). Softwarization using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)in 5G networks are expected to fill the void of programmable control and management of network resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and updated solutions related to 5G network slicing using SDN and NFV. Firstly, we present 5G service quality and business requirements followed by a description of 5G network softwarization and slicing paradigms including essential concepts, history and different use cases. Secondly, we provide a tutorial of 5G network slicing technology enablers including SDN, NFV, MEC, cloud/Fog computing, network hypervisors, virtual machines \& containers. Thidly, we comprehensively survey different industrial initiatives and projects that are pushing forward the adoption of SDN and NFV in accelerating 5G network slicing. A comparison of various 5G architectural approaches in terms of practical implementations, technology adoptions and deployment strategies is presented. Moreover, we provide a discussion on various open source orchestrators and proof of concepts representing industrial contribution. The work also investigates the standardization efforts in 5G networks regarding network slicing and softwarization. Additionally, the article presents the management and orchestration of network slices in a single domain followed by a comprehensive survey of management and orchestration approaches in 5G network slicing across multiple domains while supporting multiple tenants.

(NFV) concept offers network operators the ability
to provide more scalable and less expensive services,
free from the limitations inherent to hardware devices. However, in 5G networks, the functions must
be deployed not only in large central data centers,
but also in the edge. We propose an algorithm that
solves the Virtual Network Function Chain Placement
Problem allowing a fine management of these rare
resources in order to respond to the greatest number
of requests possible. Because networks can be divided
into several entities belonging to different tenants who
are reluctant to reveal their internal topologies, we
propose a heuristic that allows the NFV orchestrator
to place the function chains based only on an abstract
view of the infrastructure network. We leverage this
approach to address the complexity of the problem in
large mono- or multi-tenant networks. We analyze the
efficiency of our algorithm and heuristic with respect
to a wide range of parameters and topologies.

The goal of an NSP is to maximize its revenues by selling as much as possible SLAs. However, provisioning too much SLAs might increase the risk of violations of the committed QoS thus impacting the NSP’s reputation. In order to determine the appropriate provisioning strategies, we propose to extend existing solutions based on Reinforcement Learning with reputation-awareness so that NSPs maximize their revenues.},

	abstract = {Trust and reputation systems represent a significant trend in decision support for Internet mediated service provision. The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing and proposed systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation for Internet transactions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this area, and to propose a research agenda for trust and reputation systems.},

	doi = {10.23919/CNSM.2017.8256052},
	abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows new approaches to provide Quality of Service (QoS). In legacy networks, strict QoS guarantees often result in bandwidth over-provisioning. Then, QoS enforcement either consumes too many resources, or is not flexible enough. We present a solution to provide QoS based on the creation of on-demand MPLS tunnels with guaranteed bandwidths across an SDN network. We introduce an SDN Traffic Engineering Management (STEM) module that interacts with the northbound applications to satisfy their requests to forward QoS-guaranteed traffic flows. STEM delegates the path selection to a Path Computation Element (PCE), and the path enforcement to an SDN controller. We rely on a stateful PCE to record the attributed resources and estimate the remaining network capacity, avoiding overloading the network with monitoring traffic. Upon STEM requests, the SDN controller enforces the QoS policy in the data plane. User flows are aggregated into MPLS tunnels and packets are labeled with a priority depending on the flow effective bandwidth. We highlight the shortfalls of several material and software OpenFlow compatible switches and detail an implementation based on a pica8 switch to overcome them. The experimental results demonstrate that this solution efficiently enforces bandwidth sharing in SDN networks.},

	abstract = {Downlink data rates can vary significantly in cellular networks, with a potentially non-negligible effect on the user experience. Content providers address this problem by using different representations (e.g., picture resolution, video resolution and rate) of the same content and switch among these based on measurements collected during the connection. If it were possible to know the achievable data rate before the connection establishment, content providers could choose the most appropriate representation from the very beginning. We have conducted a measurement campaign involving 60 users connected to a production network in France, to determine whether it is possible to predict the achievable data rate using measurements collected, before establishing the connection to the content provider, on the operator's network and on the mobile node. We show that it is indeed possible to exploit these measurements to predict, with a reasonable accuracy, the achievable data rate.},

	abstract = {Segment Routing is a new architecture that leverages the source routing mechanism to enhance packet forwarding in networks. It is designed to operate over either an MPLS (SRMPLS) or an IPv6 control plane. SR-MPLS encodes a path as a stack of labels inserted in the packet header by the ingress node. This overhead may violate the Maximum SID Depth (MSD), the equipment hardware limitation which indicates the maximum number of labels an ingress node can push onto the packet header. Currently, the MSD varies from 3 to 5 depending on the equipment manufacturer. Therefore, the MSD value considerably limits the number of paths that can be implemented with SRMPLS, leading to an inefﬁcient network resource utilization and possibly to congestion. We propose and analyze SR-LEA, an algorithm for an efﬁcient path label encoding that takes advantage of the existing IGP shortest paths in the network. The output of SR-LEA is the minimum label stack to express SR-MPLS paths according to the MSD constraint. Therefore, SR-LEA substantially slackens the impact of MSD and restores the path diversity that MSD forbids in the network.},
